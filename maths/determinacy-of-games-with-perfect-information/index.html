The answer is simple: It&rsquo;s because games are fun! We have been playing games for millenia. When we are playing a game, we sure would like to win. If we study games, we can better understand how the game works, and what would be a good strategy to win it. But, first, we should ask is it even possible to win? Or is the game rigged against you. Determining whether it is possible to win will be the main concern for us in this article.</p><p>Here are some examples of games:</p><ul><li>Chess</li><li>Checkers</li><li>Go</li><li>Nim</li><li>Tic-tac-toe</li></ul><p>Here are some more:</p><ul><li>Poker</li><li>Battleship</li><li>Ludo</li><li>Snakes and ladders</li><li>Stone, Paper, Scissors</li></ul><p>In this article, we will only look at games of the first kind. In particular, we want games that satisfy the following five properties:</p><ul><li><em>two-player:</em> The games are played by two players: Player 1 and Player 2. We will call them $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ for short.</li><li><em>turn-based:</em> The moves are made turn by turn, and not simulataneously. Note that we don&rsquo;t require the turns to alternate between players. It is possible for the same player to play multiple turns in a row. Stone, Paper, Scissors is an example of simultaneous moves.</li><li><em>perfect information:</em> This means that no information is hidden from the players. Both players know the rules and the state of the game at all times. This excludes games like Poker and Battleship.</li><li><em>no chance moves:</em> There is no luck involved in the game. The way the game proceeds is completely determined by the initial position and the decisions taken by the players. We rule out games such as Snakes and Ladders, Ludo, and Catan where dice are rolled or cards are drawn.</li><li><em>zero sum:</em> If one player wins, then the other player loses. We will not allow ties / draws. You may object: chess does have draws. We can resolve this issue by redefining the game. We may say that if the game is a draw, then it is a victory for Black.</li></ul><h2 id=game-trees>Game trees</h2><p>Games can be quite varied. Chess is quite different from Nim. We will develop a definition of a game that will abstract away the extraneous details and focus on the underlying structure of the games.</p><p>We will define a game to be a <em>rooted tree</em> $T$. We now describe what the vertices and the edges of the tree represent.</p><h3 id=states>States</h3><p>The vertices of $T$ correspond to the <em>states</em> of the game.</p><p>We think of a game as a set of states and some relation between them. The game begins in an initial state. One of the players plays a turn, and that changes the state of the game to a new state.</p><p>A game can be thought of as a set of states $X$. A state (also called position or configuration) contains information about the history of moves that the players have played so far in order to reach the current state.
As a game is played, the game goes through different states.</p><p>We partition the set $X$ into two sets: $X_1$ and $X_2$. If the game is in state $x$, and $x \in X_i$, then it is Player $i$&rsquo;s turn to play next.</p><p>It will be convenient to represent this information as a directed graph $T$. The vertices of the graph are the states of the game.
Let $x_0$ be the initial state of the game.</p><h3 id=plays>Plays</h3><p>In addition to the set of states, we also need a set of rules to describe the rules of the game. The rules tell us that if the game is in state $x$, then what are the possible next states the game could go to. In order words, theses are the legal moves available to the players.</p><h3 id=objectives>Objectives</h3><h3 id=strategies>Strategies</h3><p>For each state $x$, if there is a legal move that move the game to a different state $x&rsquo;$, then the graph has an directed edge from $x$ to $x&rsquo;$. The out-neighbours of $x$ are all the states that one is allowed to go to from $x$.
Note that $x_0$ has no in-edges. All other states have exactly one in-edge each.</p><p>For each state $x$ that is not the initial state, we denote by $f(x)$ the <em>predecessor state</em> of $x$. That is, if the game is in state $x$, then it must have been in state $f(x)$ in the previous turn. Now, for each state $x$, the inverse $f^{-1}(x)$ denotes the set of states that can be the next-states of $x$.</p><p>We will look at both finite games and infinite games. Finite games are those that end after finitely many moves, whereas infinite games go on for infinitely many moves. Most games that we play end are finite.</p><p>For each state $x$ in $X$, there is exactly one path from $x_0$ to $x$ in the graph. We can find this path by repeatedly applying $f$ starting from $x$ until we eventually reach $x_0$. Therefore, the graph $T$ is a tree rooted at $x_0$. The notation $T$ now makes sense.</p><figure class=inline-svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" width="182.68782pt" height="139.16434pt"

For every strategy $\sigma$ of Player 1, Player 2 has a strategy such that the resulting play is winning for Player 2. Similarly, no matter what strategy Player 2 picks, Player 1 has a strategy such that they win the game. In other words, none of the players have a winning strategy.
