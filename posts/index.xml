<![CDATA[<p>The noon (12:00) rarely corresponds to the time when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.</p>
<p>Local noon will vary from place to place, and also depends on the day of the year.</p>
<p>The earth makes an angle of 23.5 degrees with the plane. It</p>
<p>The poles do not see the sun for long periods of time.</p>
<p>For places that between 23.5 degrees north and 23.5 degrees south, (also known as Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricon respectively) there are days when there is zero shadow.</p>
<p>If you live outside these latitudes, then this will never happen.</p>
<p>I am staying in Mumbai, which is at 19.1 degrees north latitude. Every year, 15 May and 26 Aug are zero shadow days.</p>
<p>Everything looks surreal, kind of like a video game where the shadows do not render.</p>
<p>This site by alok is a great place to visualise when zero shadow days occur at what places.
They have made an Android app as well.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Most research talks are being held online post lockdown, and as a result, one can access talks from all over the world.
I came across a website that lists upcoming research seminars and makes it easier to discover interesting talks.</p>
<p><a href="https://researchseminars.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://researchseminars.org/</a></p>
<p>This website was launched in April 2020 shortly after lockdown began.
It lists upcoming talks and seminars held in universities all over the world.
You can filter talks by topic, language, institution, and more.</p>

<p>For each talk, the site shows details such as the title, abstract, speaker, the targeted audience, and a link to the seminar&rsquo;s website.
Most talks have a livestream link available (either interactive like Zoom / Google Meet / Microsoft Teams or viewing only such as Youtube).
Links for some talks are not be available unless you register on this site.</p>
<p>Try to attend and participate in talks that pique your interest. The feeling of being able to attend a talk held halfway across the world is unmatched.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>December is here, which means it&rsquo;s problem solving season!</p>
<h2 id="maths">Maths</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Scroggs</a> has posted the seventh edition of the <a href="https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/blog/91" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent calendar of maths puzzles</a> on his blog. A new puzzle is unlocked everyday, and you have until the end of the year to submit the answers. The first twenty-four puzzles each have a three digit solutions, and these solutions form the clues required to solve the main puzzle on the 25th.
Ten people who solve all puzzles correctly are randomly selected to win a T-shirt!</p>
<p>The problems are mostly from number theory and combinatorics, which are coincidentally two of my favourite areas of mathematics. I believe most people would find the problems interesting and challenging. I have solved the last three editions of this advent, and plan to solve it this year as well.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>This year, we get the seventh <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</a> by <a href="http://was.tl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Wastl</a>. Two programming puzzles are unlocked every day.
Solving these puzzles requires basic programming skills, but more importantly, critical thinking skills.
You are free to use any programming language to solve them. You can even use pen and paper, although I would not recommend it.
I recently started learning the functional programming language Haskell, and I am using it to solve these puzzles. I am loving the experience so far.</p>

<p>If you know any other puzzles happening in December (or any other time of the year really), <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/contact/">let me know</a>!</p>
