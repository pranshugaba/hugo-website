<h2 id="whats-new-with-me">What&rsquo;s new with me</h2>
<ul>
<li>My batchmates from TIFR and I are conducting a Chai and Why session on <time datetime="2022-05-29T11:00:00+05:30">Sunday, May 29 (tomorrow) at 11 am</time>. It will be an hour-long interactive session where we explore puzzles related to graph theory. The venue is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/978614999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruparel College, Matunga West, Mumbai</a>. You can drop by if you are around, or you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qakLY2e_YMo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch it live on YouTube</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://pranshugaba.com/minis/7/">I went to a book fair</a> and bought some books by weight, and then <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/minis/8/">went to a book store</a> and bought some more books.</li>
<li>I started playing the overwhelmingly positively rated puzzle game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Baba is You</em></a>. I have only played the first 15 levels, but the concept is amazing and I have never seen anything like it before. In this game, you move around blocks to change the rules of the game to be able to clear each level. It&rsquo;s brilliant.</li>
<li>I began reading <em>Following the Equator</em> by Mark Twain. It is humorous and informative. You will find an excerpt from the book below. <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/reads/">Also see my reading list →</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="curated-content">Curated content</h2>
<p>Here are some titbits that I found this week that you might enjoy.</p>
<h3 id="some-youtube-videos">Some YouTube videos</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twAP3buj9Og" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Who made these circles in the Sahara?</a> is an excellent video by Vox. Inspired by a peculiar observation made by a Redditor while browsing Google Earth, <a href="https://www.vox.com/authors/christophe-haubursin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christophe Hausbursin</a> leads an investigation trying to solve the mystery behind the mysterious circles seen in the Saharan desert.</li>
<li>Two Ryan Georges discuss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwu1rCjb1Fk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how the traps and riddles around ancient relics were designed</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54sGWJd8tg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joel Haver has fun standing on a pile of rocks</a>, even though it&rsquo;s not safe.</li>
<li>And finally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v89pVOW2aE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a joke by Norm MacDonald</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-song">A song</h3>
<p><em>Numb Little Bug</em> by Em Beihold<br>

<h3 id="and-an-excerpt">And an excerpt</h3>
<p>Mark Twain&rsquo;s take on crossing the International Date Line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sept. 8.—Sunday. We are moving so nearly south that we cross only about two meridians of longitude a day. This morning we were in longitude 178 west from Greenwich, and 57 degrees west from San Francisco. To-morrow we shall be close to the center of the globe—the 180th degree of west longitude and 180th degree of east longitude.</p>
<p>And then we must drop out a day—lose a day out of our lives, a day never to be found again. We shall all die one day earlier than from the beginning of time we were foreordained to die. We shall be a day behindhand all through eternity. We shall always be saying to the other angels, “Fine day today,” and they will be always retorting, “But it isn’t to-day, it’s tomorrow.” We shall be in a state of confusion all the time and shall never know what true happiness is.</p>
<p><cite>&ndash; Excerpt from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Following the Equator</em>, by Mark Twain</a></cite></p>
