<a href=https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42/ target=_blank rel=noopener>A new version of Fedora (42, yay!)</a> was released recently, and with it came <a href=https://release.gnome.org/48/ target=_blank rel=noopener>a new version of GNOME (48)</a>.
Each GNOME release is named after a city, and GNOME 48 is named &ldquo;Bengaluru&rdquo;, a city that I lived in for four years and absolutely love.</p><p>GNOME 48 is not a major update, but it comes with several quality-of-life improvements.
While many of the features new to GNOME 48 already exist in some form in other desktop environments and/or operating systems, it is great to see them included in GNOME.</p><ul><li>Multiple notifications from the same application now stack. This reduces clutter and makes the notification panel better organised.</li><li>You can now limit charging your device to 80%. This reduces the strain on your battery and will improve the battery health in the long run, especially if you keep your laptop plugged in all day.</li><li>The default interface font was changed from Cantarell to Adwaita Sans, a modified version of <a href=https://rsms.me/inter/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Inter</a>. I love how Inter looks. In fact, I use Inter widely across my site.</li><li>My favourite new feature in GNOME 48 is <em>Wellbeing</em>, which gives you screen time information and regular eyesight and movement break reminders.</li></ul><figure class=gnome-screenshot><picture><source srcset=https://pranshugaba.com/articles/wellbeing-in-gnome-48/wellbeing-dark.webp media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src=https://pranshugaba.com/articles/wellbeing-in-gnome-48/wellbeing-light.webp alt="The wellbeing interface in GNOME settings."></picture><figcaption>The wellbeing interface in GNOME settings.</figcaption></figure><p>With Screen Time, I can now track how long I use my devices each day.
It also gives me the option to limit the usage in a day, after which the screen turns greyscale.
I have set the daily limit to be 8 hours, which while generous, helps me limit the time spent in front of the screen.
The Screen Time feature in macOS is more advanced:
it has features such as focus modes, time tracking on a per-app basis, and syncing usage data across devices.
While I would love to see some of these features included in GNOME, I am still happy with the simple implementation that we currently have.</p><p>I find the break reminders in GNOME very useful.
When I am working, it is very easy for me to become engrossed in my work and spend hours at a stretch staring at the screen without moving.
Break reminders remind me every once in a while to take a break.
The screen dims and a notification appears, telling me what to do.</p><ul><li>Eyesight reminders tell me to look away from the screen, into the distance, for about 20 seconds.
This gives my eyes some much needed rest.</li><li>Movement reminders tell me to get up and move around for a while. I take movement breaks for five minutes every thirty minutes.
During the break, I get up, move around the room, stretch my body, and do some light workout.
I also finish up small tasks such as organising my desk and my room, and refilling my water bottle.
In some breaks, I simply stare out of the window and think about how I want to spend the next 25 minutes.</li></ul><p>When these breaks end, there is an audible ding, indicating that it is time to resume work.
I have found that taking these short breaks immensely improve my wellbeing, just as the name of the feature suggests.</p></div></div><div class=page__navtags><h2 class=page__tags__heading>Tags</h2><ul class=page__tags><li><a class=page__tags__link href=https://pranshugaba.com/tags/linux/>linux</a></li><li><a class=page__tags__link href=https://pranshugaba.com/tags/gnome/>gnome</a></li></ul></div></article><div class=page__related><h2 class=page__related__heading>Related pages</h2><ul class=page__related__ul><li><a href=https://pranshugaba.com/dev/i-broke-my-arch/>I broke my Arch System</a></li></ul></div><nav class=page__nav><h2 class=page__nav__heading>More articles</h2><div class=page__nav__prev><div class=page__nav__prev__title><span>&#8592;</span> Previous article</div><a href=https://pranshugaba.com/articles/of-mice-and-men/>Of Mice and Men</a></div><div class=page__seeall><a href=/articles class=page__seeall__link>See all articles &#8594;</a></div></nav></main><footer class=site__footer><div class="[ footer__copyright ] [ plain-link ]"><a href=/licence/>Â© 2025 Pranshu Gaba</a></div><div class="[ footer__links ] [ plain-link ]"><a href=/archive/>archive</a>
