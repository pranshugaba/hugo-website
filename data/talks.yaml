- title: The Canadian traveller problem
  abstract: >
    Roads in Canada often get blocked due to excessive snowfall during blizzards. On encountering a road closure, a driver needs to adapt their route on-the-fly (possibly involving backtracking) in order to minimise the time taken to reach their destination. This problem is known as the Canadian traveller problem.

  
    Formally, given a graph with partially observable edge weights, the goal is to synthesise a strategy that minimises the total weight of a walk to the target vertex, where an edge weight is only learnt on visiting an endpoint of the edge. We look at two different variants of this problem:

    - [PY91] The edge weights are chosen by an adversary. We want a strategy with the best competitive ratio, that is, one that minimises the ratio of the total weight of the walk taken to that of the total weight of the walk given by an optimal offline algorithm.

    - [KN07] The edge weights are given by a probability distribution. We want a strategy that minimises the expected total weight of a walk to the destination.

- title: Courcelle's theorem
  abstract: "Given a graph, we are often interested in deciding if it satisfies a certain property. Some simple examples of graph properties include connectivity, bipartiteness, and planarity.  Courcelle's theorem gives parameterized upper bounds for decidability of a wide class of graph properties. Specifically, Courcelle's theorem is a metatheorem that states that if a graph property is definable in monadic second-order logic on graphs, then the property is decidable in linear fixed-parameter tractable time with the graph treewidth as the parameter. This theorem finds many uses in automata theory and model checking. We will study the theorem and look at some of its applications."

- title: Stochastic Window Mean-payoff Games
  abstract: 'Stochastic two-player games model systems with an environment that is both adversarial and stochastic. The environment is modelled by a player (Player 2) who tries to prevent the system (Player 1) from achieving its objective. We consider window mean-payoff objectives: these are finitary versions of the traditional mean-payoff objective, obtained by replacing the long-run average of the payoffs by average payoffs computed over a finite sliding window. We present complexity bounds and algorithmic solutions for computing strategies of Player 1 to ensure that the objective is satisfied with positive probability, with probability 1, or with probability at least p, regardless of the strategy of Player 2. The solution crucially relies on a reduction to the special case of non-stochastic two-player games with the same objective. We also give a general characterisation of prefix-independent objectives for which this reduction holds. This is a joint work with Laurent Doyen and Shibashis Guha.'
