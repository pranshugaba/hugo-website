<![CDATA[<p>When you are giving a presentation, say, at a conference, you want to be able to move around the stage.
You do not want to be tethered to your laptop behind the podium, and you definitely don&rsquo;t want to be yelling &ldquo;NEXT&rdquo; to a person at the keyboard each time you want to change the slide.</p>
<p>You could go and purchase one of the presenter pointer clickers available in the market.
They usually come with a USB dongle that you insert in your laptop.
They have forward and back buttons that let you change slides and a laser pointer that you can use to point at things on the slides.</p>
<p>While these devices are not very expensive, they aren&rsquo;t exactly cheap either.
And it is one more device that you have to carry with you and ensure that its battery is not dead.
Many presentation venues are now equipped with a bright LED display instead of a projector.
Your standard laser pointer is not going to stand a chance against the blinding lights of the display.
No one is going to be able to see it the pointer.
You could get a pointer with a brighter laser, but this can be dangerous.
You must ensure that you don&rsquo;t blind anybody in your lovely audience.
And no matter how bright your laser is, it is only going to work for the audience that is in the same room as you.
Since the laser is not captured in a screenshare, the people who are watching your talk in a livestream and/or recording would have no choice but to guess what you are pointing at.</p>
<p>There are some products where you get a software pointer, that is, they make a red dot appear on your computer that is also visible in screen recordings.
But every such presentation remote that I have come across forces you to install their own (often laggy and proprietary) software for Windows devices, and offers no support for Linux computers at all (which is what I use).</p>
<p>In this post, we see how to implement a presentation remote with a laser pointer, without having to buy any hardware or installing any proprietary software on your devices.
This procedure works perfectly with my setup: a laptop running Fedora Linux (specifically, GNOME with Wayland) and an Android phone.
You should be able to adapt the instructions if you are running some other Linux distribution and desktop environment.
I do not have a Windows or a macOS computer or an iPhone to test out which, if any of the steps below, break.</p>

<h2 id="one-time-setup">One-time setup</h2>
<p>The following steps need to be performed only once to set things up between your phone and your laptop.</p>
<h3 id="installing-kde-connect">Installing KDE Connect</h3>
<p>The key ingredient &mdash; the most crucial part of this setup &mdash; that will let you control your laptop remotely from your mobile phone is <a href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KDE Connect</a>.
KDE Connect is one of the most versatile and magical and useful application that I have ever used.
You can use it to share files across devices, control your laptop&rsquo;s media playback from your phone, use your phone as a keyboard and touchpad for your laptop, use your laptop&rsquo;s keyboard and touchpad as an input method for your phone, and so much more.
Today, we will use KDE Connect to use our phone as a remote presentation controller.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can get KDE Connect for your Android device from either the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Play Store</a> or <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F-Droid</a>.
Install the app and grant the permissions that it asks for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You would also need to install KDE Connect on your laptop.
On GNOME, it suffices to install the <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GSConnect GNOME extension</a>.
Upon installation, you can check the status of the GSConnect application from the Quick Settings panel.
For desktop environments other than GNOME, you would most likely need to install KDE Connect from your distribution&rsquo;s package manager.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pairing-your-devices">Pairing your devices</h3>
<p>The next step is to pair your phone and your laptop.
Both of your devices would need to be on the same Wi-Fi network.
If you do not have a Wi-Fi network available, you can also connect your laptop to your phone&rsquo;s hotspot and everything works just fine.</p>
<p>Both devices should be able to see each other now.
They should both appear in the each other&rsquo;s list of available devices.
Click on &ldquo;Pair&rdquo; from one device and accept the connection from the other device.</p>

<figure >

    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>If you expand the GSConnect quick setting tile and if the devices are paired and connected, you should be able to see the current battery and network status of the phone and also see some commands that you can send to the phone.
You can send a ping from your phone to your laptop.
If all went well, you should see a notification on your laptop.</p>

<figure >

    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Click on &ldquo;Presentation Remote&rdquo; in the KDE Connect app on your phone and you will see buttons to change slides and to enable the pointer.
This is really a fancy restricted keyboard and mouse in disguise.
The forward and next buttons send the events <code>Prior</code> and <code>Next</code> respectively to your computer.
In the three-dots-menu, you have the commands &ldquo;Full-screen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Exit presentation&rdquo; which are aliases for <kbd>F5</kbd> and <kbd>Escape</kbd> respectively.
If you hold down the pointer button and move your phone around, you should be able to see the cursor move around the screen.</p>

<p>Open a presentation file and try everything out.
At this point, we are functionally done.
Everything works, but we would like to make this more beautiful.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-cursor-shape-and-size">Changing the cursor shape and size</h3>
<p>Instead of the default mouse cursor, I would like to show bright red laser dot during presentations.
This can be easily achieved by changing your cursor theme to a red dot.
The GoogleDot cursor looks great and you can <a href="https://github.com/ful1e5/Google_Cursor/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download it from its GitHub page</a>.
You can find red, blue, black, and white dot cursors.</p>
<p>Download <code>GoogleDot-Red.tar.gz</code> and extract it in <code>~/.local/share/icons</code>.
You can create this directory if it doesn&rsquo;t exist.
You can now select the new cursor theme from GNOME Tweaks, or by running the following command.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">gsettings <span class="nb">set</span> org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme <span class="s1">&#39;GoogleDot-Red&#39;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If the cursor appears slightly small for your liking, you can go to Settings -&gt; Accessibility -&gt; Seeing -&gt; Cursor size and choose a size that you like.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can also change the cursor size from the command line.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">gsettings <span class="nb">set</span> org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size <span class="m">36</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="customizing-the-cursor-hide-timeout">Customizing the cursor hide timeout</h3>
<p>All of my presentations are PDF files, and I use the <a href="https://apps.gnome.org/Papers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Papers application</a> to show my presentation.
When in presentation mode in Papers, by default, the cursor remains visible for about 5 seconds.
I like the cursor to hide after a shorter duration.</p>
<p>I could not find a configuration to change the timeout in Papers, but I did find a GNOME extension called <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6727/hide-cursor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hide Cursor</a> that hides the cursor after a period of inactivity.
Unfortunately, as of writing, a timeout of 5 seconds is hardcoded in this extension. Fortunately, the source of the extension is very simple and you can change the value of the timeout in the file.</p>
<p>By default, the extension is installed at <code>~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/hide-cursor@elcste.com</code>.
In this directory, in the <code>extension.js</code> file, edit the <code>5</code> to your preferred timeout.
I have set it to 3 seconds.
Now when you enable this extension, your cursor should disappear after the timeout that you have set.
(Note that if this extension is updated in the future, your changes will be overwritten and this file will revert back to its default state as written by the extension developer. You would have to change the timeout again.)</p>
<h2 id="during-the-presentation">During the presentation</h2>
<p>The setup is now done.
Now, when it is time for your presentation, you only have to follow these easy steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the laptop to your phone&rsquo;s hotspot and check if the devices can see each other.</li>
<li>Change the cursor theme from GNOME Tweaks.</li>
<li>Change the cursor size from Accessibility in GNOME settings.</li>
<li>Enable the &ldquo;Hide Cursor&rdquo; extension.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now open your PDF in Papers or your slideshow in LibreOffice Impress, go fullscreen by pressing the <kbd>F5</kbd> key, and you are now ready to present with your laser pointer phone!</p>
<p>After your presention is done, undo the above changes to get back to your normal mouse cursor appearance.</p>
<h3 id="using-the-terminal">Using the terminal</h3>
<p>I find it easier to execute the above steps in one go by running the following commands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">gsettings <span class="nb">set</span> org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme <span class="s1">&#39;GoogleDot-Red&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">gsettings <span class="nb">set</span> org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size <span class="m">32</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">gnome-extensions <span class="nb">enable</span> hide-cursor@elcste.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>To undo the changes, I run the following script.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">gsettings <span class="nb">set</span> org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme <span class="s1">&#39;Adwaita&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">gsettings <span class="nb">set</span> org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-size <span class="m">24</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">gnome-extensions disable hide-cursor@elcste.com
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="pros-and-cons-of-this-remote-clicker-implemenation">Pros and cons of this remote clicker implemenation</h2>
<h3 id="pros">Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>You do not need to buy an additional device or install any proprietary software.</li>
<li>The pointer is visible in screen shares and video recordings and there is no risk of blinding the audience with a laser.</li>
<li>Works beautifully and people are impressed by this setup.</li>
<li>Very easy to set up.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cons">Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>This method only works if you can use your own laptop for presentation. If you have to use the venue&rsquo;s computer, plugging a USB presenter dongle is still the most convenient solution.</li>
<li>I have encountered a bug where the pointer goes permanently in the pressed mode and the cursor keeps moving even if you have not pressed the pointer button. The only thing that fixes this is disconnecting and reconnecting the devices.</li>
<li>Some people may not like that you are holding your phone in your hand with the screen turned on during your presentation.
I wish that you could use your phone&rsquo;s hardware buttons instead of having on-screen buttons.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[<p>I <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/uses/">use</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedora Linux</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME desktop environment</a> on all of my computers.
<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new version of Fedora (42, yay!)</a> was released recently, and with it came <a href="https://release.gnome.org/48/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new version of GNOME (48)</a>.
Each GNOME release is named after a city, and GNOME 48 is named &ldquo;Bengaluru&rdquo;, a city that I lived in for four years and absolutely love.</p>
<p>GNOME 48 is not a major update, but it comes with several quality-of-life improvements.
While many of the features new to GNOME 48 already exist in some form in other desktop environments and/or operating systems, it is great to see them included in GNOME.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple notifications from the same application now stack. This reduces clutter and makes the notification panel better organised.</li>
<li>You can now limit charging your device to 80%. This reduces the strain on your battery and will improve the battery health in the long run, especially if you keep your laptop plugged in all day.</li>
<li>The default interface font was changed from Cantarell to Adwaita Sans, a modified version of <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter</a>. I love how Inter looks. In fact, I use Inter widely across my site.</li>
<li>My favourite new feature in GNOME 48 is <em>Wellbeing</em>, which gives you screen time information and regular eyesight and movement break reminders.</li>
</ul>

<p>With Screen Time, I can now track how long I use my devices each day.
It also gives me the option to limit the usage in a day, after which the screen turns greyscale.
I have set the daily limit to be 8 hours, which while generous, helps me limit the time spent in front of the screen.
The Screen Time feature in macOS is more advanced:
it has features such as focus modes, time tracking on a per-app basis, and syncing usage data across devices.
While I would love to see some of these features included in GNOME, I am still happy with the simple implementation that we currently have.</p>
<p>I find the break reminders in GNOME very useful.
When I am working, it is very easy for me to become engrossed in my work and spend hours at a stretch staring at the screen without moving.
Break reminders remind me every once in a while to take a break.
The screen dims and a notification appears, telling me what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eyesight reminders tell me to look away from the screen, into the distance, for about 20 seconds.
This gives my eyes some much needed rest.</li>
<li>Movement reminders tell me to get up and move around for a while. I take movement breaks for five minutes every thirty minutes.
During the break, I get up, move around the room, stretch my body, and do some light workout.
I also finish up small tasks such as organising my desk and my room, and refilling my water bottle.
In some breaks, I simply stare out of the window and think about how I want to spend the next 25 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>When these breaks end, there is an audible ding, indicating that it is time to resume work.
I have found that taking these short breaks immensely improve my wellbeing, just as the name of the feature suggests.</p>

<p>I am pleasantly surprised that it takes me almost the same time by cycle as it takes by public transport (bus + train + bus).</p>
<p>On the way, I sighted the Incredible Hulk, tandem bicycle bunnies, and a beautiful sunrise!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I came across an old hardbound copy of <em>Of Mice and Men</em> in the librerie<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> at TIFR.
The title seemed familiar and intriguing, the quality of the hardbound was excellent, and the golden ochre pages had the mesmerising old paper smell:
it was hard not to pick this book up.
It is a short and captivating read and I finished it in a few days.
I liked it so much that I wanted to share my thoughts on it here.</p>

<h2 id="spoiler-free-review">Spoiler-free review</h2>
<p>The book is primarily a tale of two men: George Milton (who is small and witty) and Lennie Small (who is slow and brawny).
The story takes place along the Salinas river near the Gabilan mountains, a few miles south of Soledad, California.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
The two men are going to go work on a ranch to buck barley, and this is where they (and the reader) meet a slew of characters.
There are conflicts in no time, and the story gets tense quickly.
I go into more detail on this in the <a href="#review-with-spoilers">spoiler section of the review</a>.</p>
<p>The plot is well-paced, well-written, and there is always some action taking place.
It is simple, and yet, it keeps you hooked.
There is vivid description of nature and the passage of time, which helps set the scene and the setting of rural America.</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The day was going fast now. Only the tops of the Gabilan Mountains flamed with the light of the sun that had gone from the valley.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The flame of the sunset lifted from the mountatintops and dusk came into the valley&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Now the light was lifting as the sun went down, and the sun streaks climbed up the wall and fell over the feeding racks and over the heads of the horses.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;The sun streaks were high on the wall by now, and the light was growing soft in the barn.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Already the sun had left the valley to go climbing up the slopes of the Gabilan Mountains, and the hilltops were rosy in the sun.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Only the topmost ridges were in the sun now.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Also contributing to the tone is the grammar of the dialogue of the characters.
The characters speak with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_negative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">negative concord</a>, that is, they use double negatives even when they want to make a negative statement.
They also use words and phrases such as &ldquo;sets&rdquo; and &ldquo;could of&rdquo; and &ldquo;ast&rdquo; and &ldquo;purty&rdquo; and &ldquo;pitchers&rdquo;.
It didn&rsquo;t take long for me to understand what the characters were saying.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>
It was fun to read this dialogue as it made the characters real and believable.</p>
<p>I loved reading this novella!
I suggest that you read the book before proceeding further to the section with spoilers so as to not deprive yourself of the opportunity to experience this story.</p>

        <p>Spoilers for the plot of <em>Of Mice and Men</em> up ahead.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<h3 id="george-and-lennie">George and Lennie</h3>
<p><em>Of Mice and Men</em> is a tragedy concerning many men, a woman, and hardly any mice.
The story is set in a world where each man is on his own, and in this setting, the two protagonists are an unlikely duo who always stick together.
The two men could not be more different.
George knows how to talk to people, and how to get out and stay out of trouble, whereas Lennie gets heavy physical labour done like it&rsquo;s a piece of cake.
George wishes he would not have to take care of Lennie all the time, and that he would be better off alone.
However, he knows that this is not true.
George cares for Lenny, and Lenny cares for George as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t no cuckoo,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dumb as hell, but he ain&rsquo;t crazy. An&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t so bright neither, or I wouldn&rsquo;t be buckin&rsquo; barley for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit smart, I&rsquo;d have my own little place, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d be bringin&rsquo; in my own crops, &lsquo;stead of doin&rsquo; all the work and not getting what comes up outa the ground.&rdquo;
<cite>&mdash; George speaks of Lennie</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="petting-and-rabbits">Petting and rabbits</h3>
<p>Lennie does not remember things well.
Lennie forgets most things.
George has to constantly keep reminding him of what events took place recently, and this also tells us what happened.
We learn two crucial points at the start of the story: we learn that something bad happened in Weed, which is why they were on the lam, and that Lennie loves to pet mice.
Lennie loves petting all things (especially mice), but since he is so big and strong, he inadvertently kills the mice.
Lennie is deeply interested in is rabbits.
He wants a simple life, and he would like nothing better than to pet animals.
And he likes rabbits better than mice because they are larger, and he could pet them harder without killing them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant no harm, George. Honest I never.&rdquo;
<cite>&mdash; Lennie</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lennie is like a big baby.
His actions are cruel, but his intentions are not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sure he&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; like a kid. There ain&rsquo;t no more harm in him than a kid neither, except he&rsquo;s so strong.&rdquo;
[&hellip;]
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice fella,&rdquo; said Slim. &ldquo;Guy don&rsquo;t need no sense to be a nice fella. Seems to me sometimes it jus&rsquo; works the other way around. Take a real smart guy and he ain&rsquo;t hardly ever a nice fella.&rdquo;
<cite>&mdash; Slim speaks of Lennie</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-characters">The characters</h3>
<p>As the pair reach their new workplace, we meet a bunch of new characters.
We are introduced to Candy, an old swamper, who lost his arm in an accident at the ranch.
We also briefly see the boss, the owner of the ranch.
There is Curley, the son of the owner who is always looking to cause trouble, and there is Curley&rsquo;s wife, who got married to Curley just two weeks ago.
In addition, we also come across Slim, Carlson, Whit, and other workers.
Finally, we also hear of Crooks, a person of color who is the stable buck.</p>
<h3 id="dreaming-of-a-better-future">Dreaming of a better future</h3>
<p>George is focussed on getting their own land, their own mansion.
This idea seems grandiose to everyone else, no one believes that this can succeed.
No one except George and Lennie (and later Candy).
George has told this story to Lennie so many times that they (even Lennie!) remember it by heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George&rsquo;s voice became deeper. He repeated his rhythmically as though he had said them many times before. &ldquo;Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family. They don&rsquo;t belong no place. They come to a ranch an&rsquo; work up a stake and then they go inta town and blow their stake, and the first thing you know they&rsquo;re poundin&rsquo; their tail on some other ranch. They ain&rsquo;t got nothing to look ahead to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>An&rsquo; live off the fatta the lan&rsquo;</em>,&rdquo; Lennie shouted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>George is cunning, he knows ways to help him achieve his goal.
For example, when he learns from Candy that they will get money for their stake if there is an accident on the ranch, he orchestrates and instigates a fight between Curley and Lennie, knowing all well that Lennie will hurt Curley, and that Lennie may get hurt too.
At the end, they manage to extract compensation from Curley.</p>
<p>They were on their way to earn enough money for the stake.
Unfortunately, as it turned out, the events at the end of the book made it impossible for their dream to come as it turns out.</p>
<h3 id="the-people-are-all-on-their-own">The people are all on their own</h3>
<p>A recurring motif throughout the book is that everyone is either alone or ends up alone.</p>
<p>Carlson insists that they kill Candy&rsquo;s old dog.
They say that Candy&rsquo;s dog is old and of no use, and stinks, and has rheumatism.
However, Candy loves and values his dog.
After all, they have grown up together.
Carlson suggests to shoot the dog in the back of the head with his Luger pistol.</p>
<p>We see that Crooks is alone as he is a &ldquo;colored man&rdquo;.
It is only Lennie, who does not have any of the inhibitions or prejudices against Crooks because of race, who talks to him.</p>
<p>We see that no one speaks to Curley&rsquo;s wife, for she is a woman.
What&rsquo;s worse is that she remains an unnamed character throughout the book; Steinbeck does not even give her a name.</p>
<p>In the climax of the story, Lennie means no harm, but ends up killing a pup, and then kills Curley&rsquo;s wife as well.
Candy is the first to find out, and George finds out too soon thereafter.
George knows that Curley and others will not like what George did.
This is a repeat of the Weed incident all over again, but even worse this time.
George tries to convince Curley and Carlson to let Lennie live, but they do not listen.
He has no choice but to go along with the others.</p>
<p>We cut to Lennie in his safe spot, as instructed by George.
George leads the rest of the gang to Lennie.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no people,&rdquo; George said. &ldquo;I seen the guys that go around on the ranches alone. That ain&rsquo;t no good.  They don&rsquo;t have no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin&rsquo; to fight all the time.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t many guys travel around together,&rdquo; he mused &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why. Maybe ever&rsquo;body in the whole damn world is scared of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot nice to go around with a guy you know,&rdquo; said George.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="cyclical-story-and-foreshadowing">Cyclical story and foreshadowing</h3>
<p>The story is cyclical in nature.
The book begins near a pool, with sycamore trees, and a heron, and both men walking towards the pool, and Lennie has done something bad, unintentionally.
The book ends with all of these conditions.
I half expected the book to end as it started, showing a recurring loop.
However, what happens is much darker.</p>
<p>George ends up killing Lennie.
He talks to Lennie about their dream one final time, and then shoots him in the back of his neck with the Luger, just how Candy&rsquo;s dog died.
The only difference being, that it was George himself who killed his &lsquo;dog&rsquo; unlike Candy.</p>
<p>I feel terrible for Lennie.
Lennie died even though he didn&rsquo;t mean any harm.
In some ways, it was a worse ending for George, as he has to live with the fact that he killed his friend, and now he ends up alone, just like everyone else.</p>

<p>I learned from the author bio, and later from the introduction, that Steinbeck was born in Salinas where the story is set.
My edition had an introduction by Joseph Henry Jackson where he talked about the life and the personality of Steinbeck.
As a general rule, I never read the introduction before reading the main text since it is often riddled with spoilers for the story, or with thoughts and trivia about the author&rsquo;s life.
I like to go in a book blind and not be affected by such additional information, and come back to it only after I have finished reading the book.
The only time when this rule failed me was in <em>Lolita</em>, where the introduction is in fact diegetic.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

I wanted to eat a new kind of a sandwich, and this is what I came up with.
This sandwich contains mangoes and mint leaves and basil leaves.
The mangoes give it a rich and sweet taste, while the herbs bring in a hint of freshness.
It makes for a quick, easy, and tasty meal for the summer.

<![CDATA[<p>I love solving crosswords.
I started solving them in 2020, during lockdown, and haven&rsquo;t stopped since.
I solve the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York Times Crossword</a> everyday.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Lately, I have started solving crosswords on <a href="https://www.puzzmo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Puzzmo</a>, a website that launched in late 2023.
In addition to the Crossword, the site also features puzzles such as Typeshift, Flipart, and Really Bad Chess everyday.</p>
<p>At the start of this month, Puzzmo ran an open submission contest where any Puzzmo user could create and submit a crossword puzzle (as long as they have not been paid to create a crossword before).
If accepted, you would be paid for it and your submission would appear on Puzzmo sometime later this year.</p>
<p>I had never made a crossword puzzle before and I was fascinated by it.
I decided to try my hand at it and quickly discovered how difficult it is to create an American style crossword.
The number of constraints that one needs to juggle is immense.
The hardest for me were the lack of unchecked squares and two-letter words.
Even with the help of crossword constructing tools (I used <a href="https://crosshare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crosshare</a> and <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Crosswords.Editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gnome Crosswords editor</a>) to draw the grid and suggest words, I found myself struggling to satisfy all the constraints.
I tried (and failed) to incorporate rotational, or even vertical, symmetry in my puzzle, but in the end, I am content that I was even able to come up with a grid and fill it with words.</p>
<p>Next came writing the clues, and I was not prepared for that! Striking the right balance between a gimme or unsolvable was tough. The holy grail of clues in my opinion is one that looks cryptic at first glance, but with some lateral thinking and an aha moment, gives a feeling of brilliance and satisfaction and makes the solver feel smart. Clue writing is something that I will get better at only with practice.</p>
<p>I was notified yesterday that my puzzle wasn&rsquo;t accepted because it has a lot of &ldquo;gluey&rdquo; fill, a view that I agree with.
However, I am still proud of my construction and can share it with you now!
I have published my puzzle on <a href="https://crosshare.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crosshare</a>, a free and open-source website where you can construct and publish crosswords, and also solve crosswords published by other users.
I can&rsquo;t wait for you to try it!</p>

<p>I now have a greater appreciation for all those who construct crossword puzzles.
I would like to thank Puzzmo for conducting this open submission week!
I had a great time creating the puzzle and I look forward to constructing more in the future :)</p>
<p>Good luck, have fun!</p>

<p>If you are stuck on a clue, let me know and I will give you a hint. Also, feel free to search the web for any trivia that you do not know.</p>

<p>I would love your feedback. Did you find the puzzle interesting? Or was it too easy / too difficult?</p>

<p>Or, at least, I attempt to solve it everyday.
The difficulty of NYT crosswords increases as the week progresses.
I am usually able to solve Mondays to Thursdays, but Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays still elude me.
For instance, I have a 66-week streak for Mondays, but have only solved 2 or 3 Saturdays so far.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<h3 id="new-tablet">New tablet</h3>
<p>I used to use an iPad with an Apple Pencil to jot down notes.
However, the Pencil broke, and a new one is not cheap.
I decided to get a new tablet, an Android this time.
I am loving it so far.
I will write a post sharing my experience with the new tab soon.</p>
<h3 id="apprendre-le-français">Apprendre le français</h3>
<p>One of <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter/2023-W01/#languages">my goals this year</a> has been to learn more languages.
One of the languages I want to get better at is français, that is, French.
I had learnt some French in school, but I was not very good at it, and I had forgotten most of it by now anyway.
I resumed actively learning French a few months ago.</p>
<p>To improve my writing skills, I will post short essays in French here on my site.
I have written <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/articles/on-commence/">the first essay</a> already where I briefly introduce myself in French.
I will write about interesting events in my life, as well as document my French learning experience, all of it in French.
If you are a French speaker, please have a read and let me know if you find mistakes or have suggestions to improve my writing.</p>
<h3 id="new-photopoems">New photopoems</h3>
<p>This week, I posted two new photopoems: <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/poems/barcode/">a haiku</a> and <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/poems/the-nine-bollards-with-faces/">a limerick</a>.
Here is one of the photos.</p>

<h3 id="new-comic">New comic</h3>
<p>I had drawn <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/comics/1/">a comic</a> about ghosts a long long time ago, during lockdown.
The new tablet has inspired me to pick up drawing once again.
I have drawn a <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/comics/2/">new comic</a> with the same characters.</p>

<h3 id="books--tv-shows">Books / TV shows</h3>
<ul>
<li>I have started reading a novel titled <em>Riddley Walker</em> by Russell Hoban.
It may not look like it is written in English, but it (mostly) makes sense if you read it out aloud.
It takes quite a bit of effort to read and understand it though.</li>
<li>I have been watching more of British TV panel shows lately.
I am currently on Richard Osman&rsquo;s House of Games (Series 7), Taskmaster (Series 16), Only Connect, and University Challenge (Series 53).
These are all immensely entertaining.</li>

<h3 id="pictures-of-the-solar-eclipse">Pictures of the solar eclipse</h3>
<p>There was an annular solar eclipse last week that was visible from some parts of the Americas.
Thanks to NASA, we get to see images of the eclipse from two unusual perspectives.</p>

<h4 id="geoguessr-world-cup">GeoGuessr world cup</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoGuessr</a> is a game where you are shown a Google Street View image.
You must look around for clues (such as landmarks, road signs, the flora and the fauna) to sleuth out your location on the globe.
It is a lot of fun.
I love playing this game and watching others play it too.
One of my favourite players to watch is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVt1GKBZMzc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoWizard</a>.</p>
<p>The first ever <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0OzZOrs8wmcPWwL2JD3kXRLRVFcbD1uU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeoGuessr world cup</a> happened this week.
It was a massive event, with players from all around the world.
The matches had live commentary and there was a huge prize pool of over $50,000.
It was thrilling to see the pros battle it out.</p>
<h4 id="an-epic-game-of-rock-paper-scissors">An epic game of Rock Paper Scissors</h4>
<p>CGP Grey has posted a challenge where you must <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmWQmZXYd74" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play a series of games of Rock, Paper, Scissors</a> with him.
You win if you can win 20 games in a row.
Can you devise a strategy to beat him?
Will Lady Luck be on your side?
See how far you can get.
Don&rsquo;t cheat.</p>
<p>Assuming that you win each game with chance 1/3, the probability that you win twenty games in a row is roughly 1 in 3.5 billion.
It is <em>highly</em> unlikely that anyone will able to achieve this feat.
Also keep in mind that he uses mind tricks to affect your decision.
Regardless of how many games you win, it is a fun game to play.
With millions of people expected to play this game, we are in for some juicy statistics.</p>
<h4 id="a-poetic-review">A poetic review</h4>
<p><em>Cocoon</em> is a new indie puzzle game directed by a designer of the games <em>Limbo</em> and <em>Inside</em>.
The gameplay looks stunning, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efgBO69P1Kw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">videogamedunkey&rsquo;s review</a> is just poetry.</p>
<h4 id="bat-canned">Bat-canned</h4>

Watch the two amazing comedians Pete Holmes and Thomas Middleditch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs66p5jQ9dM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batman fires The Batman</a>.
Also check out another series by Pete Holmes called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBIeL6Ot52KOPa87HrwLgtSF3lLczz_9E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ex-Men</em></a> where he parodies characters from the X-Men series, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDdHYjb5sBk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Badman</em></a> where he parodies Batman.</p>
<h4 id="the-holy-grail">The Holy Grail</h4>
<p>It is the 48th and ½ anniversary of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, so the movie is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b52A3sKz-I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rereleasing in theaters</a> once again.
Unfortunately, it seems like it will only release in theaters in the United States and for two days only.</p>
<h3 id="a-game">A game</h3>
<p>The New York Times now has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new game called &ldquo;Connections&rdquo;</a>.
If you are a viewer of the quiz show Only Connect, you may already be familiar with this game.
You are given a wall of sixteen seemingly unrelated words/phrases, and your goal is to divide the clues into four groups of four clues each, each with some connection.
This games can get tricky because of red herring, which are clues that may belong to more than one connection.
Sometimes, it is difficult to see any connections between the clues at all, while at other times you may find five, or even six, clues satisfying the same connection.</p>
<p>It is fun to play this everyday.
I wish they would credit Only Connect for the format of the game.
You can only play the current day&rsquo;s game on The New York Times&rsquo; website.
There is another website where you can <a href="https://connections.swellgarfo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play past puzzles</a>.
On this site, you can also create your own puzzles and share them with others.</p>
<h3 id="a-song">A song</h3>

<h3 id="and-an-excerpt">And an excerpt</h3>
<p>Do you know how far New Zealand is from Australia?
The answer may surprise you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it would not look too much like showing off, I would tell the reader where New Zealand is; for he is as I was; he thinks he knows. And he thinks he knows where Hertzegovina is; and how to pronounce pariah; and how to use the word unique without exposing himself to the derision of the dictionary. But in truth, he knows none of these things
<cite>&ndash; Excerpt from Chapter XXVI, Following the Equator by Mark Twain</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you think New Zealand is close to Australia or Asia? Read on&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All people think that New Zealand is close to Australia or Asia, or somewhere, and that you cross to it on a bridge. But that is not so. It is not close to anything, but lies by itself, out in the water. It is nearest to Australia, but still not near. The gap between is very wide. It will be a surprise to the reader, as it was to me, to learn that the distance from Australia to New Zealand is really twelve or thirteen hundred miles, and that there is no bridge.
<cite>&ndash; Another excerpt from Chapter XXVI, Following the Equator</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would recommend that you read the entire chapter, and if possible, the entire book.
It&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious, and you also get to learn a ton of obscure 19th century geography facts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! See you in the next one. &#x1f44b;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Bonjour à tous !
Comment ça va ?
Bien, j&rsquo;espère.</p>
<p>Il y a quelques temps, j&rsquo;ai commencé à apprendre le français, et j&rsquo;aimerais le pratiquer.
En fait, j’avais appris du français en école, mais j&rsquo;ai presque tout oublié.
Alors, j&rsquo;écrirai une nouvelle chaque semaine, ici sur mon site.</p>
<p>D&rsquo;abord, je me présente.
Je m&rsquo;appelle Pranshu.
J&rsquo;ai 25 ans.
Je suis étudiant et chercheur à «Tata Institute of Fundamental Research», où je suis en quatrième année.
J&rsquo;étudie l&rsquo;informatique théorique, des méthodes formelles.
Plus précisément, je travaille sur la théorie de logique, automates et jeux.</p>
<p>L&rsquo;université est située en Colaba, le plus au sud de Mumbai.
Elle est très jolie.
Elle donne sur la mer et l&rsquo;on peut voir les bâtiments à Malabar.
J&rsquo;adore regarder le ciel orange et le coucher de soleil tous les soirs.
L&rsquo;université est au milieu d&rsquo;une zone navale, donc, il y a très peu de choses à faire près d&rsquo;ici.
Cependant, il y a beaucoup de restaurants et sites touristiques à Fort, à seulement vingt minutes d&rsquo;ici en bus.
Par exemple, il y a la porte de l&rsquo;Inde, le musée et des galeries d&rsquo;art.
J&rsquo;aime bien mon université !</p>
<p>Alors, c&rsquo;est tout pour aujourd&rsquo;hui.
Je vous souhaite une bonne semaine.
À la prochaine !</p>
<hr>
<p>Si vous trouvez des erreurs dans ce texte, n&rsquo;hésitez pas à <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/contact/">me contacter</a>.
J&rsquo;apprends le français et je fais des fautes.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I had been busy the last few months writing a research paper. However, now, May is here, the paper is submitted, the semester has ended, and I have some free time on my hands.</p>
<h2 id="some-news-for-you">Some news for you</h2>
<h3 id="chai-and-why">Chai and Why</h3>
<p>I, along with Varun, Eeshan, and Ashutosh from the School of Technology and Computer Science in TIFR are organizing a fun outreach session of Chai and Why.
Entry is open and free for all!
See you tomorrow morning at 11, at Prithvi Café, Juhu.

<h3 id="new-preprint">New preprint</h3>
<p>I have been working on a problem on stochastic games with window mean-payoff objectives with <a href="http://www.lsv.fr/~doyenhiba" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laurent Doyen</a> and <a href="https://www.tifr.res.in/~shibashis.guha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibashis Guha</a> for the better part of the past year.
We finally finished writing the paper and uploaded a preprint on arXiv.org:
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11563" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stochastic Window Mean-payoff Games</a>.
With this, I now have a page on <a href="https://dblp.org/pid/345/7987.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dblp</a>!

<h3 id="final-space-ends">Final Space Ends</h3>
<p>When <em>Final Space</em> was unceremoniously cancelled after Season 3 with the biggest cliffhanger ever, it was a very sad day.
The good news now is that the creator of the show, Olan Rogers, is getting a chance to complete the story in the form of a graphic novel.
I highly recommend that you watch this show.
If you are outside the US, you can watch it on Netflix till December 2023.
You can <a href="https://finalspaceends.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order the graphic novel</a> to support Olan for what will undoubtedly be an arduous road ahead.
Almost 20,000 copies have already been sold in less than two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="whats-playing">What&rsquo;s playing</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Broadway Musical <em>The Sound of Music</em> started playing in Mumbai from May 3. I watched it on the opening night and loved it. The acting, singing, and dancing by the cast is phenomenal. The live music by the orchestra was amazing as well.

</li>
<li>For some reason, all eight Harry Potter movies are back in theaters in Mumbai. I missed watching the first four movies in the theaters, so this is a chance to experience them on the big screen.</li>
<li>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 released this week as well. While I am no longer interested in the MCU, the reviews for this film are looking positive, and I might go watch it after all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="some-interesting-videos">Some interesting videos</h2>
<p>Here are some videos were uploaded on YouTube in the last week that I liked.</p>
<h3 id="quirky-keyboards">Quirky keyboards</h3>
<ul>
<li>A video about the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BytowtVycc0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">history of the arrow keys on keyboards</a> by the 8-bit guy.
Almost every keyboard you can find today has arrow keys (or cursor keys) in an &ldquo;inverted T&rdquo; shape. However, this has not always been the case.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s something wrong with Joel Haver&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s keyboard. It&rsquo;s not a typical QWERTY keyboard. He uses the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWoDSsCX1S8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blomfu keyboard</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="marbula-one-s4">Marbula One S4</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtXf1yhf01k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Season 4 of Marble racing begins!</a> It is fun to watch the marbles make laps across the track while listening to the captivating commentary.</p>
<h3 id="ai-generated-memes">AI generated memes</h3>
<p>YouTuber demonflyingfox became famous last month for creating AI generated videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE39q-IKOzA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry Potter Balenciaga</a>.
Now they are back with another AI generated video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygWsjr9qhVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breaking Bad in German</a>. Wandlung zum Bösen!</p>
<h3 id="epic-npc-man">Epic NPC man</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another epic NPC man video by VLDL. A bug in the programs of two NPC muggers in the town of Honeywood leads to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfzGbAh3nNI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hilarious outcome</a>.</p>
<h3 id="elliot-is-a-cool-guy">Elliot is a cool guy</h3>
<p>Elliot, a graphic designer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAk9SZ9yrMY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tries out a bunch of graphic design softwares</a> to make posters.
The programs that he tries out include Photoshop, Canva, Inkscape, GIMP, and even Excel.
My favourite one is of course Inkscape!</p>
<h3 id="book-graphs">Book graphs</h3>
<p>In this episode of Numberphile, James Grimes talks about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw2Pl_Nk3CA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">book embeddings of graphs</a>.
These are an interesting generalization of planar graphs.
The vertices of a graph are placed in a single line that forms the &lsquo;spine&rsquo; of a book.
No two edges between two vertices allowed to intersect.
We can avoid edge intersections by embedding the edges in different &lsquo;pages&rsquo;.
The problem is, given a graph, to find the minimum number of pages required to embed the graph.
After watching the video, you can also read the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07630" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the paper on arXiv</a>.
They show that four pages are sufficient to embed any planar graphs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! See you in the next one. &#x1f44b;</p>

<p>Does it seem strange to see arrow keys in a line? The text editor vim does that. In vim, you can press <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd> to move the cursor left, down, up, and right respectively.
I will be posting more tips about vim in the future.
Once you try vim, you cannot go back.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<![CDATA[<p>The year 2022 is over, and a new year has begun.
In this issue of my newsletter, I share some highlights of the past year, as well as some goals that I have set for the coming year.</p>
<p>As always, if you would like to read previous issues, you can do so at <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter/">https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter</a></p>
<h2 id="my-highlights-of-2022">My highlights of 2022</h2>
<h3 id="travel-in-2022">Travel in 2022</h3>
<p>I travelled to a fair share of new places in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="kolkata">Kolkata</h4>
<p>I went to a friends&rsquo; wedding in Kolkata in April. It was my first visit to the city, and I loved the sights and the foods there.
I walked across the Hooghly river along the Howrah bridge, bought novels from College street, and ate some roadside phuchka.

</p>
<h4 id="israel">Israel</h4>
<p>I attended the <a href="https://www.floc2022.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLoC conference</a> in Haifa, Israel in August.
This was my first time in a new country on my own and it was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>Haifa is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been to.
The city sits on a hill, which means that walking in the city is akin to trekking.
Haifa also abuts the beautiful Mediterranean sea and it was a delight to swim in those cool blue waters.
While I missed some of the Indian spices in the food there, I loved the bread, the hummus, and the falafels.

</p>
<h4 id="chennai">Chennai</h4>
<p>I attended the <a href="https://www.fsttcs.org.in/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FSTTCS conference</a> in IIT Madras in December.
The campus of IIT Madras (along with Guindy national park) is a literally a forest in the middle of the city and is teeming with deer and monkeys.
I had never seen so many deer up close before.</p>
<p>Chennai is great city to go for a walk in.
I went for a <a href="https://madrasinherited.in/walk/kutchery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heritage walk</a> on Kutchery road in Mylapore where I learnt about the rich history of the various shops and establishments in that locality.

</p>
<h3 id="books-in-2022">Books in 2022</h3>
<p>After a slump of 4 years, I picked up reading this year again.
Here are some of the books that I read this year and particularly enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Stranger</em> by Albert Camus<br>
A short novella in two parts. A very interesting read. I cannot say anything more about this book without spoiling it.</li>
<li><em>A Terrible Book</em> by Jay Micheal<br>
This bellyachingly hilarious book is a parody of almost every literary trope that exists. It is available as an eBook for $0.99 on Kindle, and nowhere else. The author remains elusive, but it is not for a lack of trying. I am not able to find any information about the author other than his short bio and brilliantly drawn self-portrait on this book&rsquo;s listing on Amazon.</li>
<li><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky<br>
This book shares themes with <em>The Stranger</em>.
This book is about what drives a man to kill a person, and the mental anguish that he suffers as a consequence.
The plot slows down and is drawn out at times, but I think that it is necessary to better understand the plight of the antihero.</li>
<li><em>The Book Thief</em> by Markus Zusak<br>
Set during the Second World War, this story follows the life of a little girl living in Nazi Germany who loves to read books. A tale narrated by Death himself, you can&rsquo;t not read this.</li>
<li><em>Project Hail Mary</em> by Andy Weir<br>
While this book is science fiction, but it doesn&rsquo;t read as such.
Everything that happens in the story seems scientifically plausible; you might as well be reading the logs of a real astronaut.
It is great to see the thought process of the protagonist as he tackles the problems he encounters.
Once I started reading it, it was downright impossible to put it down.
I finished reading it in less than three days.</li>
<li><em>Elantris</em> by Brandon Sanderson<br>
This is a fantasy novel and one of the first books published by Brandon Sanderson.
The story is told through the points-of-view of three characters: a prince, a princess, and a priest, each having different motives and personalities.
It is particularly fun when these characters interact and you experience the same scene from different viewpoints.
I also loved the magic system in this story.
This is a standalone book and a complete story on its own. All in all, it&rsquo;s a very satisfying and thrilling book.</li>
<li><em>The Sword of Kaigen</em> by M. L. Wang<br>
This is a fantasy book with a Japanesque setting.
I could feel some vibes of  <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> while reading this book, primarily because some characters can manipulate the elements around them.
If you liked that show, then you will probably enjoy reading this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more books that I have read and would like to read.
You can have a look at my <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/reads/">reading list</a> that I regularly keep up-to-date.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows-and-movies-in-2022">TV Shows and Movies in 2022</h3>
<p>It was a great year for movies and TV Shows.
Here are some of my favourites of the year.</p>
<h4 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Barry (season 3)</em><br>
The penultimate season of the series.
This show is an unusual combination of drama and comedy, where the eponymous character Barry is both an actor and an assassin.
Now, his worlds are about to collide.
Barry is played by Bill Hader who is amazing in this role.
He also writes and directs some of the episodes.</li>
<li><em>The Rehearsal (season 1)</em><br>
A masterpiece by Nathan Fielder. Very meta. It is safe to say that this show is like none other. I was surprised to find out that there will be another season of this show.</li>
<li><em>Better Call Saul (season 6)</em><br>
A satisfying end to the chicanery of Saul Goodman and to the Breaking Bad universe. It&rsquo;s all gone now. Bravo Vince!</li>
<li><em>House of the Dragon (season 1)</em><br>
I will be honest, my expectations for this show were super low after seeing how <em>Game of Thrones</em> ended.
However, I was convinced otherwise before the first episode ended.
This show has a lot of plotting, stabbing, and backstabbing, and keeps you at the edge of your seat.
George R. R. Martin is, of course, a masterful story teller, and the showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik have done an excellent job translating it to screen.
A special shout-out to Paddy Considine, who was phenomenal as King Viserys.
This was a rare occurence where I watched the show before reading the book.
I have got to read <em>Fire and Blood</em> now.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</em><br>
An amazing action-comedy movie starring Nicholas Cage as Nick Cage, as well as Pedro Pascal. This is a fun movie to watch.</li>
<li><em>Chello Show</em><br>
A Gujarati movie about a boy fascinated by movies.</li>
<li><em>Bullet Train</em><br>
Another action-comedy movie. As the name suggests, this almost entirely takes place on a bullet train. This movie has great action sequences, and the dialogue and story are quite good too.</li>
<li><em>Glass Onion</em><br>
While I didn&rsquo;t like it as much as <em>Knives Out</em>, it was still entertaining to see Detective Benoit Blanc back on screen.</li>
<li><em>The Menu</em><br>
Anya Tayloy-Joy and Ralph Fiennes are great in this, and so are the supporting cast.
Not sure if this is a horror or a comedy.
It is definitely absurd.
A culinary delight.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="games-in-2022">Games in 2022</h3>
<p>Some games that I discovered and enjoyed playing this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Duotrigordle / Redactle / Worldle</em><br>
Wordle became popular at the start of this year, and we saw many new *le games.
These were the ones that I played the most.</li>
<li><em>NYTimes spelling bee and crossword</em><br>
I try to solve the NYT Spelling Bee daily and the crossword whenever I can. I can usually only solve the Mondays and Tuesdays crosswords.</li>
<li><em>Dark Souls</em><br>
I started playing Dark Souls. I was initially hesitant, or even scared to play it. However, the Souls-like games are so good and they have spoiled most other games for me. Praise the sun! \o/</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-goals-for-2023">My goals for 2023</h2>
<p>I have set some goals for myself for this year.</p>
<h3 id="reading-and-writing">Reading and writing</h3>
<p>I would like to write more often and on a regular basis.
I want to be uploading new content on this website more frequently.
I also want to read more books this year.</p>
<h3 id="getting-fit">Getting fit</h3>
<p>I will start going to the gym or cycling regularly.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>I want to learn more languages and become a hyperpolyglot.
I plan to achieve</p>
<ul>
<li>native fluency in ગુજરાતી,</li>
<li>moderate fluency in français, and</li>
<li>basic conversational fluency in मराठी and Deutsch.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will use flashcards and Rosetta Stone to improve my vocabulary and grammar.
I will also try to read literature, watch movies, and connect with native speakers to practice and get better at these languages.</p>
<h3 id="game-development">Game development</h3>
<p>I want to get good at game development.
By the end of the year, I want to be comfortable enough with the game engine Godot that creating simple arcade style games such as Tetris, Pacman, and Flappy Bird are second-nature to me.
I would also like to make and publish one or two moderately complex games.
I would need to collaborate with someone for the aspects of gamedev that are not my fortes such as pixel art and sound design.</p>
<hr>
<p>I will also post some short term goals, and from time to time share updates on how I am progressing along these goals for 2023.
<a href="https://pranshugaba.com/contact/">Let me know</a> what have you planned for this new year!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! See you in the next one. &#x1f44b;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I am back after a bit of a break. To make up for it, here&rsquo;s a longer than usual issue of my newsletter where I share updates about me, this site, and other miscellaneous things.
Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new since the last issue:</p>
<h2 id="recent-updates">Recent updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grant Sanderson of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Blue1Brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3Blue1Brown</a> is back this year with another Summer of Maths Exposition (SoME #2). The goal of this contest is to encourage people to create some awesome maths explainers. You can <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/articles/some-2/">read my article on SoME #2</a> for more details about the contest. There&rsquo;s only one month left to submit your explainers, so this is a good time to get started!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GMTK Game Jam 2022 is live! The GMTK game jam started in 2017 and has been taking place every year in July since then. The theme of this year&rsquo;s jam is &ldquo;Roll of the Dice&rdquo;. You must create and share a playable game based on the theme in less than 50 hours. It is not easy to create a game that works and is also fun to play in this short period of time, and yet each year, we see some amazing games come out of these game jams.<br>
<a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about the GMTK game jam 2022 →</a></p>
<p>Only 24 of the 50 hours of the jam are left at the time of writing this post, so it would be difficult for you to submit a game for this game jam if you didn&rsquo;t know about it before. You can, however, play the games submitted in the jam and vote for the ones you like. You can also start preparing for next year&rsquo;s GMTK game jam. GMTK&rsquo;s YouTube channel is great place to learn about concepts in game design. Pick a game engine such as Godot or Bevy and start making your own game!</p>
<p>The GMTK game jam is only one of the very many game jams that happen. You can find more <a href="https://itch.io/jams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jams on itch.io</a>. The schedule is jam-packed with game jams. There is always some jam in progress and some upcoming jams that you can look forward to participate in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of games, I started playing <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>.
It&rsquo;s another masterpiece by From Software. In this game, you are a Shinobi warrior in Japan trying to fight Dragonrot.</p>
<p>It is a fun and exciting game that rewards persistence, determination, and exploration. The game seems terrifyingly difficult, and at times, even impossible. However, you must remember that the developers of this game are on your side. They want you to succeed. Keep trying! You will learn something with each death, you <em>will</em> get better at this game. When you finally defeat that difficult boss that you were stuck on for so long, it&rsquo;s the best feeling in the world.</p>

  <figure >

              I am down to my last of health and I have used up all health potions and pellets after defeating a difficult boss. I realise to my horror that the boss has a second phase.

  </figure>
  

<p>Sekiro differs from the Dark Souls games in many aspects. Unlike Dark Souls, this game has only one weapon, the sword. It does not punish you for teleporting to the last checkpoint. The game let&rsquo;s you die once and resurrect without having to start from the last checkpoint. There is no stamina meter, you can keep sprinting without tiring. There is even a jump button in this game!</p>
<p>And yet, it is a From Software game at heart. The combat is fun, you will die again and again and again, dying will hurt as you will lose your precious skill points and coints, and of course, there is no difficulty setting. I have played it for about 15 hours and am stuck on some difficult bosses, but I am confident I will be able to defeat them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em> last week. It was a delight to hear Steve Carell&rsquo;s voice as Young Gru. I also loved that we got to meet the younger versions of many characters from the Despicable Me movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a great time to be watching TV shows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first episode of <em>Better Call Saul</em> after the mid-season break premiered last Monday. The episode was one hour long, but it was so packed with action that it only felt like five minutes. I was holding my breath and was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The story is approaching the start of Breaking Bad when we first see Saul in that show. There are only five episodes left and the show will be over in five weeks. I will be sad when this show ends :(</li>
<li>Volume 2 of <em>Stranger Things 4</em> came out on July 1. Unfortunately for me, some details of the ending were spoiled for me, but I enjoyed watching the show nonetheless.</li>
<li>Season 2 of <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> is going on. It is as intriguing as the first season. Steve Martin and Martin Short are an amazing duo.</li>
<li>The first two episodes of season 4 of <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> premiered this Tuesday. Nadja, Nandor, Lazlo, and Gizmo are all reunited once again!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote a photopoem titled <em>rain train</em>. Here&rsquo;s the photo

<h3 id="youtube-videos">YouTube videos</h3>
<p>Here are some YouTube videos that I watched and enjoyed recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q_05PUYv1o&amp;list=PLNYkxOF6rcIAKIQFsNbV0JDws_G_bnNo9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP 203</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qen5CKjUe8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassie Evans talks to Jake about about SVG paths</a> and what the various letters and symbols in an SVG file mean. The SVG format is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turtle graphics</a> most commonly seen in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logo programming language</a>. I am loving the new episodes of HTTP 203, but this does not mean I don&rsquo;t miss Surma.</li>
<li>I used to <em>love</em> playing the Harry Potter games on PC. Which is why I was delighted when I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-A2XlJsC84" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Christo Vuchetich, a game designer who worked on the Harry Potter PC games</a>. It is incredible how the game was made in a year with very little access to how the Harry Potter movies would look like. An interview on the Chamber of Secrets game is coming soon.  I cannot wait to watch it.</li>
<li>The team at Polygon play a game of Clay-O-Rama which is like DnD, but the players make clay figurines of their characters. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbEBGf1J_qw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simone, Pat, and Christina play the game with Jenna as their DM</a>.</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="online-games">Online games</h3>
<p>You may enjoy playing these games:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular tic-tac-toe becomes boring after a while. If both players play optimally, then the game will end in a tie. I would like to introduce you to a bidding version of the same game. In regular tic-tac-toe, both players take turns alternatingly to place their respective symbol on the grid. In the bidding version, both players start with a limited fund of say 100 points. At the start of each turn, they both bid some points. The player with the higher bid gets to place their symbol on the grid but must pay their bid amount to the other player.</p>
<p>The players must not only decide where to place their symbol in their turn in case they win the bid, but they must also decide how much to bid. Should they go all in in the start and occupy a good starting square? Or should they save their points for the endgame to play several turns at one and deliver a deathblow? You can try it yourself and play with a friend on this website: <a href="http://biddingttt.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bidding TTT</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might have played the game Wordle where you try to guess a word in 5 tries. You may like <a href="https://www.quordle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quordle</a> more. In this game, you are required to guess four words within nine guesses. In case this was not enough, you can try <a href="https://duotrigordle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duotrigordle</a>. In this game, you must guess 32 words and you have 37 guesses to do so.  It was surprised to find that Duotrigordle was easier than Quordle.  Let me know which variant of Wordle is your favourite.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-songs">Two songs</h3>
<p>Here are two songs from Eurovision that you may enjoy:</p>
<ul>

<![CDATA[<h2 id="last-year">Last year</h2>
<p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown</a> held a contest named SoME #1. The name is short for <em>The Summer of Math Exposition</em>. In this contest, Grant asked people to submit maths explainers &mdash; something that explains a concept in maths (or physics or computer science). This explainer could be of any form: a short video, a blog post, an interactive webpage, or even a game! The goal of this contest was to encourage more people to create explainers.</p>
<p>There are multiple benefits to this. One, it improves the collection of resources available to all for learning new things (More than a 1000 entries were submitted!). Everyone has a different learning style, and similarly, everyone has a different teaching style. Even if someone has made a video explaining a particular concept, the way you explain the same topic will be different. Some people will find their content easier to understand, and some will find your content easier to understand. The more high-quality content there is out there, the higher the chance that you will find something that you can connect to.</p>
<p>Secondly, when you explain a concept to someone else, you tend to dispel misconceptions you may have had about the topic, and you might find an easier way of thinking about a problem as you try to present it in a simple manner for the explainer. You are bound to learn something new and improve your own understanding of the subject. It is a win-win-win for everybody!</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read more about last year&rsquo;s contest on Grant&rsquo;s website</a>.
You can also find <a href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1-results#all-entries" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a list of all submitted entries</a> there. You can read/watch them at your leisure and learn many things new.</p>

<p>The #1 in SoME #1 suggested that this could be a recurring event, and sure enough, it&rsquo;s back this year as SoME #2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZuYICAEN9Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch the announcement video by Grant on YouTube →</a></p>
<p>Not much has changed from last year.
This time, there is an additional platform to help domain experts to collaborate with content producers.
A repository has been setup on GitHub to help people with complementary skills to find and connect with each other.</p>
<p>For example, say you are well-versed in topology and would like to make a game related to something in topology, but don&rsquo;t know how to make games. You can request for a game developer on the GitHub page. Similarly, if you are good at making videos but don&rsquo;t know what to make the video about, you can look for a domain expert who would like to get a video made. By collaborating with others, you can make something amazing, something that would be impossible working on your own.</p>
<p>Here are some important links for this year&rsquo;s SoME:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://summerofmathexposition.substack.com/p/the-summer-of-math-exposition-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contest rules and details</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/leios/SoME_Topics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub for collaboration and matchmaking</a></li>
<li><a href="https://discord.gg/dsp3zgB4qQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord for general discussion</a></li>

</ul>
<p>The deadline for submitting your work is 15th August 2022.
Five winners will be selected who each will be awarded a Golden Pi creature and a prize money of $1000 sponsored by Brilliant. Very exciting!</p>
<p>I will not have time to make a video this year, but I will write a series on the <em>Determinacy of Two-player Games with Perfect Information</em>. The topic is inspired by some papers that I recently read that were written by Gale and Stewart and by Donald Martin. I will upload the series on this site.</p>
<p>Good luck! I hope you make some awesome maths explainers!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>This week, I watched Volume 1 of Stranger Things 4, and it was some of the best content I have ever seen. I can&rsquo;t wait for the last two episodes of this season to land on July 1.</p>
<p>If you would like to read the previous issues, you can do so at <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="recent-updates">Recent updates</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new with me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I shared a simple but tasty recipe of a <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/recipes/tomato-cheese-sandwich/">tomato cheese sandwich</a>.</li>
<li>It has started raining in Mumbai! The first showers of rain fell on Thursday. It reminds me of a photopoem I wrote last year titled <em>torrent</em>. Here&rsquo;s the photo

and <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/poems/torrent/">here&rsquo;s the poem →</a></li>
<li>I had gone to see the Gateway of India two weeks ago, and it looked pretty in purple.

  <figure class="medium">

It looked like a gateway (get it? &#x1f60f;) to the Upside Down.</li>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I read a New Yorker article titled <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/13/the-strange-and-secret-ways-that-animals-perceive-the-world-ed-yong-immense-world-tom-mustill-how-to-speak-whale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Strange and Secret Ways That Animals Perceive the World</a> by Elizabeth Kolbert. In this article, Kolbert talks about how there&rsquo;s so much that we don&rsquo;t know about animals: we don&rsquo;t know how they sense things, how they communicate with each other and with us. For instance, a researcher named Roger Payne found out about whale songs. He discovered that whales tend to repeat a sequence of sounds&ndash;that were 7 to 30 minutes long&ndash;over and over again. He thought of these as songs sung by the whales. He recorded this and released it as an album called &ldquo;Songs of the Humpback Whale&rdquo;. NASA even included these on Voyagers 1 and 2, which are now floating in space. Any alien that encounters these space probes will get a glimpse of what whales sound like. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjkxUA041nM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen to these whale songs on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Related to this is another New Yorker article that I had read a while back: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/why-animals-dont-get-lost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Animals Don&rsquo;t Get Lost</a> by Kathryn Schulz. How do mammals, birds, and even insects such as butterflies navigate long distances and still reach at their intended destinations without the aid of a GPS? We are starting to understand this better with recent advancements in data collection, but there is still a long way to go. Both of these articles are humbling to read.</p>
<p>Speaking of whales, here&rsquo;s a news segment where Julianna McKannis asks a panel of experts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POi4rvN_Yts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Should we be teaching our children more about whales?</a></p>

<![CDATA[<img src="https://pranshugaba.com/recipes/tomato-cheese-sandwich/tomato_sandwich_featured_hu_ee3e90c1dd8ffc57.webp" alt="Tomato cheese sandwiches, cut and ready-to-eat." /><p>If you want to eat a tasty sandwich but don&rsquo;t have mint chutney on hand, I have discovered that a combination of red chilli powder, black pepper powder, and chaat masala works wonders.</p>
<p>The following recipe makes one sandwich. It takes less than 5 minutes to make one.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 slices of sliced multigrain bread</li>
<li>1 tomato</li>
<li>1 cheese slice</li>
<li>1 tsp of red chilli powder</li>
<li>1 tsp of black pepper powder</li>
<li>1 tsp of chaat masala</li>
<li>A pinch of rock salt</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut moderately thin slices of tomato and arrange them on a slice of bread. (Since this sandwich has only tomatoes and no other filling, I am generous with the tomatoes. I add 6-10 slices depending on the size of the tomato.)</li>
<li>Sprinkle rock salt, red chilli powder, black pepper powder, and chaat masala on the tomatoes.

   </figure>
   
</li>
<li>Place a slice of cheese, cover with a slice of bread, and cut diagonally into two triangles.</li>
<li>Enjoy your tomato cheese sandwich!

   </figure>
   
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cheese slice absorbs some spiciness, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to add the spices.</li>
<li>You may use brown bread (whole wheat bread) if multigrain bread is not available.</li>
<li>You can experiment with different types of breads, cheeses, and spices.</li>
</ul>

<![CDATA[<p>Hello there!
This is the second issue of my new newsletter, and it&rsquo;s the 22nd week of 2022.
Lots of two&rsquo;s this week!</p>
<p>In case you missed last week&rsquo;s issue, you can read it on my website at <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new-on-my-website">What&rsquo;s new on my website</h2>
<ul>
<li>It was Zero Shadow Day on May 15 in Mumbai. I <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/articles/zero-shadow-day/">wrote an article explaining what is “Zero Shadow Day”</a> and when you can expect to see it at your place.</li>
<li>I wrote a photopoem titled <em>high</em>. Here&rsquo;s the photo

and <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/poems/high/">here&rsquo;s the poem →</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-new-with-me">What&rsquo;s new with me</h2>
<ul>
<li>I finished reading <em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky. It is a complex book that warrants a re-read. I will start reading <em>Anna Karenina</em> by Leo Tolstoy next.</li>
<li>I also finished reading <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rust Book</a>. It is a great introduction to the Rust Programming Language and is a must-read for any aspiring Rustaceans.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="curated-content">Curated content</h2>
<p>Keeping with the theme of this issue, here are two of various things.</p>
<h3 id="two-youtube-videos">Two YouTube videos</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJSI7QTAt_o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tom Scott presents a game show titled Money</a>. In this show, five of Tom&rsquo;s YouTuber friends play for a piece of the potential prize pool of $10,000. They can win the entire amount as a group only if they work together and cooperate with each other. If someone defects and acts selfishly, the total winnings of the group falls.</p>
<p>This game is a test of trust, loyalty, and deceptiveness among the players. It is a great example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeated_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeated game</a> in action. Will the players cooperate, or will someone betray their friends for a chance to increase their personal winnings? Watch the show and find out!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a web exclusive episode of Last Week Tonight, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hk011WMM7t0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Oliver does an in-depth review of the 1997 movie Air Bud</a> which is about a dog that plays basketball. In this episode, he highlights and discusses the moral and ethical flaws of making a dog play professional basketball.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-websites">Two websites</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are tired of binging on Netflix and would like something more nutritional, check out <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHK World-Japan</a>. This is the international broadcast service of NHK, a public broadcasting organisation in Japan.
There is a wide variety of shows and documentaries available <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">On Demand</a> that you can watch for free without having to sign up.</p>
<p>A show that I liked was <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/video/2068027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Myths and Legends of Hiroshima and Shimane</a>. This show takes you on a train ride across towns in Hiroshima and Shimane, and gives a glimpse of the arts, the culture, the myths, and the legends on the way. Another show that I would like to watch is a <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/ondemand/program/video/10yearshayaomiyazaki/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-part documentary on Hayao Miyazaki</a>, the legendary Japanese filmmaker who co-founded Studio Ghibli.</p>
<p>If you are feeling nostalgic and miss the times when we all watched the same content at the same time and couldn&rsquo;t rewind or skip forward, there&rsquo;s <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Live TV</a> for you. There is also a section on the site where you can <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/learnjapanese/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn Japanese</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.redactle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A fun game called Redactle</a> that you can play in your browser. In this game, you are given a Wikipedia article with almost all words redacted. You can guess a word, and if it is present in the article, then all occurences of the word are revealed. The objective of the game is to guess the title of the article.
While there is no limit on the number of words you can guess, you can set your own targets. I like to guess the title in the shortest time, so I don&rsquo;t care how many guesses it takes.</p>
<p>This game tests your general knowledge and pattern recognition skills. Having read a lot of Wikipedia articles certainly helps. A new article is available everyday at 9.30pm IST.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-excerpts">Two excerpts</h3>
<p>This first excerpt is from Crime and Punishment. It shows the thoughts of the main character Raskolnikov moments before he is about to commit a crime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first&mdash;even long before&mdash;he had been occupied with one question: why almost all crimes are so easily detected and solved, and why almost all criminals leave such an obviously marked trail. He came gradually to various and curious conclusions, the chief reason lying, in his opinion, not so much in the material impossibility of concealing the crime as in the criminal himself; the criminal himself, almost any criminal, experiences at the moment of the crime a sort of failure of will and reason, which on the contrary, are replaced by a phenomenal, childish thoughtlessness, just at the moment when reason and prudence are most necessary. According to his conviction, it turned out that this darkening of reason and failure will take hold of a man like a disease, develop gradually, and reach their height shortly before the crime is committed; they continue unabated during the moment of the crime itself and for some time after it, depending on the individual; then they pass in the same way as any disease passes. But the question whether the disease generates the crime, or the crime somehow by its peculiar nature is always accompanied by something akin to disease, he did not yet feel able to resolve.</p>
<p><cite>&ndash; Excerpt from Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky, translated by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky
</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This second excerpt is much more light-hearted. It is a conversation that Mark Twain had while visiting Fiji in September:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;This? This is not hot. You ought to be here in the summer time once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We supposed that this was summer; it has the ear-marks of it. You could take it to almost any country and deceive people with it. But if it isn’t summer, what does it lack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It lacks half a year. This is mid-winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p><cite>&mdash; Excerpt from Following the Equator by Mark Twain</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="and-two-songs">and Two songs</h3>
<p>Here are two songs that have French names and were released in 1979:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Main dans la main</em> by Ellie et Jacno. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SolYdL5tcag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch on YouTube →</a></li>
<li><em>Voulez-Vous</em> by ABBA. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=za05HBtGsgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Watch on YouTube →</a></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for this week! See you in the next one.</p>

<li>My batchmates from TIFR and I are conducting a Chai and Why session on <time datetime="2022-05-29T11:00:00+05:30">Sunday, May 29 (tomorrow) at 11 am</time>. It will be an hour-long interactive session where we explore puzzles related to graph theory. The venue is <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/978614999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ruparel College, Matunga West, Mumbai</a>.

<li><a href="https://pranshugaba.com/minis/7/">I went to a book fair</a> and bought some books by weight, and then <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/minis/8/">went to a book store</a> and bought some more books.</li>
<li>I started playing the overwhelmingly positively rated puzzle game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Baba is You</em></a>. I have only played the first 15 levels, but the concept is amazing and I have never seen anything like it before. In this game, you move around blocks to change the rules of the game to be able to clear each level. It&rsquo;s brilliant.</li>
<li>I began reading <em>Following the Equator</em> by Mark Twain. It is humorous and informative. You will find an excerpt from the book below. <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/reads/">Also see my reading list →</a></li>

<p>Mark Twain&rsquo;s take on crossing the International Date Line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sept. 8.&mdash;Sunday. We are moving so nearly south that we cross only about two meridians of longitude a day. This morning we were in longitude 178 west from Greenwich, and 57 degrees west from San Francisco. To-morrow we shall be close to the center of the globe&mdash;the 180th degree of west longitude and 180th degree of east longitude.</p>
<p>And then we must drop out a day&mdash;lose a day out of our lives, a day never to be found again. We shall all die one day earlier than from the beginning of time we were foreordained to die. We shall be a day behindhand all through eternity. We shall always be saying to the other angels, &ldquo;Fine day today,&rdquo; and they will be always retorting, &ldquo;But it isn&rsquo;t to-day, it&rsquo;s tomorrow.&rdquo; We shall be in a state of confusion all the time and shall never know what true happiness is.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>When the clock strikes twelve during the day, we say it&rsquo;s noon. We may perceive this to be the time when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky. However, this is rarely, if ever, true.</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, let&rsquo;s say when the clock reads 12:00, it is <em>noon</em>, and when the Sun is at its highest, it is <em>local noon</em>. It will soon be clear why it&rsquo;s called it local noon.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-noon-not-the-same-as-local-noon">Why is noon not the same as local noon?</h2>
<p>The earth rotates about its axis, making a complete turn every 24 hours. Because of this, we see the Sun rise and set every day. The Earth rotates from west to east, so the Sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west.</p>
<p>Places that are in the east experience events like sunrise and sunset before places in the west. Consider Mumbai and Pune, two cities in Maharashtra, India. Because Pune is roughly 1 degree east of Mumbai, the day begins and ends in Pune slightly earlier than it does in Mumbai. We can calculate how much earlier:</p>
<p>The Earth rotates about 360 degrees in 24 hours<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. Dividing 24 hours by 360 tells us that the Earth rotates 1 degree in 4 minutes. It follows that local noon in Pune is 4 minutes before local noon in Mumbai. You can find out the sunrise and sunset times in these two cities and verify that these events occur 4 minutes earlier in Pune compared to Mumbai.</p>
<p>India is a big country; it is the seventh largest in the world by area. It spans about 30 degrees from west to east. The westernmost point of India is Sir Creek, Gujarat at 68 degrees east of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prime meridian</a> (the meridian that passes through Greenwich, London and is taken to be the zero longitude), and the easternmost point of India is in Arunachal Pradesh at 97.5 degrees east of the prime meridian. As a result, Arunachal Pradesh is about 2 hours ahead of Gujarat. Indeed, local noon is at 10:27 AM in Arunachal Pradesh and at 12:24 PM in Gujarat today.</p>
<p>Since all of India follows the same timezone (Indian Standard Time UTC+05:30), it follows that local noon does not occur at noon in most places.
The time at which local noon occurs at a place depends on the difference between the longitude of that place and the longitude corresponding to the timezone offset of that place.</p>
<p>In particular, given the timezone offset and the longitude of a place, the following formula calculates when local noon occurs there:
</p>
\[LN(z, \ell) = \left( \frac{z}{24}  - \frac{\ell}{360} \right) \times 24 \times 60\]<p>
Here,</p>
<ul>
<li>\(z\) is the timezone offset of the place. It is the number of hours the local timezone is ahead of UTC. It is a number between -12 and +12.</li>
<li>\(\ell\) is the longitude of the place. It must be a number between -180 and +180.</li>
<li>\(LN(z, \ell)\) is the number of minutes after 12:00 that local noon occurs at. If this value is negative, then local noon occurs before 12:00.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can look at an example. The timezone in Mumbai is +5:30, so we have \(z_{\text{Mumbai}} = 5.5\). The longitude of Mumbai is 72.8 degrees east, therefore, \(l_{\text{Mumbai}} = 72.8\). Substituting these values in the above formula gives
</p>
\[ LN(5.5, 72.8) = \left( \frac{5.5}{24} - \frac{72.8}{360} \right) \times 24 \times 60,\]<p>
which is approximately equal to 38. This tells us that local noon in Mumbai should be around 12:38 PM.</p>
<p>Why does this formula work? The difference in the parentheses indicates a fraction of Earth&rsquo;s complete rotation. The term \(\frac{z}{24}\) is the fraction of a rotation that timezone is ahead of UTC, and \(\frac{\ell}{360}\) is the fraction of a rotation that the longitude is ahead of the prime meridian.
The difference shows the fraction of a turn that Earth must rotate for the longitude of the place to reach the longitude corresponding to the timezone of the place.</p>
<p>We multiply this difference by \(24 \times 60\) to convert the fraction into minutes (since there are \(24 \times 60\) minutes in a day). This formula also agrees with the observation we made: the further east you go in the same timezone, the earlier local noon occurs.</p>
<p>The formula makes one assumption. It assumes that if the difference \(\frac{z}{24} - \frac{\ell}{360}\) at a place is zero, then \(LN(z, \ell)\) is also zero there, and local noon coincides with noon.
Is this a valid assumption to make?</p>
<p>For every timezone, there exists a longitude for which this difference is zero. We call this the longitude corresponding to the timezone, and it is equal to \(\frac{z}{24} \times 360\).
For example, the longitude corresponding to the Indian timezone is
</p>
\[\frac{5.5}{24} \times 360,\]<p>
which is equal to \(82.5^{\circ} \text{E}\).
The city of Vindhyachal in Uttar Pradesh, India lies on the 82.5 degrees east meridian.
Is it true that local noon is at 12:00 everyday in Vindhyachal?
Equivalently, is local noon in Mumbai at 12.38 PM everyday?
The answer to these questions is no, it&rsquo;s not that simple.</p>
<h3 id="local-noon-also-depends-on-the-time-of-the-year">Local noon also depends on the time of the year</h3>
<p>It turns out that local noon at a place changes from day to day across the year. In Mumbai, it ranges between 12.10 PM and 12.40 PM over the course of the year.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
Why does this happen?</p>
<p>The answer has got to do with the eccentricity of Earth&rsquo;s orbit. The orbit of the Earth is not perfectly circular, but is slightly squished. Kepler found out that Earth&rsquo;s orbit is elliptical with the Sun at one of the ellipse&rsquo;s foci. The distance between the Earth and the Sun increases and decreases over the course of a year. Kepler also observed that the line joining the Earth and the Sun, the area that it sweeps per unit time is constant and is independent of where Earth is on the ellipse. Therefore, when the Earth is closer to the Sun, it moves faster, and when it is further away, it moves slower.</p>
<p>This means that the time between two consecutive local noons at a place is not always 24 hours. When the Earth is closer to the Sun and it moves faster, after it makes one complete rotation, it overshoots the sun by a greater amount, and thus must rotate by a greater angle for it to be local noon again. The gap between two local noons is longer. Conversely, when the Earth is further from the Sun and it is moving slowly, it overshoots the Sun by a smaller amount, and must rotate by a smaller angle for the Sun to become overhead again. Local noons are closer together during this time.</p>
<p>It would be quite inconvenient if the length of the day was different everyday, and some days of the year were shorter than others. The solution that people came up with was to take the average length of the day and have the day be that long every day. We took the total time duration of the year, and divided it into 365 equal parts (366 in leap years). This way, every day is 24 hours long.
The downside of this approach is that local noon time changes from day to day, but that&rsquo;s not an issue for most of us.</p>
<h2 id="shadow-length-at-local-noon">Shadow length at local noon</h2>
<p>Okay, so say you have found out the time of local noon at your place today. In Mumbai, it is at 12.20 PM today.
At local noon, the Sun would be overhead, the highest it will ever be in the day, and this is the time of the day when your shadow will be the shortest.
Does this necessarily mean that your shadow will be exactly below your feet and therefore, not visible at all? The answer is no, you will still be able to see a shadow of yourself in most places.</p>
<p>At any time, there is a meridian &mdash; a semicircle joining the north and the south poles on the surface of the Earth &mdash; where it is local noon.
This &ldquo;meridian of local noon&rdquo; constantly shifts west as the Earth rotates about its axis.
This is the meridian passing through the point on Earth that is closest to the Sun.
You can convince yourself that the closest point is also the unique point on Earth&rsquo;s surface that lies on the line segment joining the centres of the Earth and the Sun. This point is also known as the subsolar point of Earth.</p>
<p>If you are on the meridian where it&rsquo;s currently local noon, then the Sun would be neither east nor west. You would see that your shadow has no component in the east-west direction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you are at the point that is closest to the sun, then the Sun be exactly overhead above you, and your shadow will not have any component in the north-south direction either. For a moment, you will experience the &ldquo;Zero Shadow&rdquo; effect. Shadows of objects would be exactly below them giving the illusion that they don&rsquo;t have shadows at all.
Things looks surreal; it feels like you are in a video game where the shadows did not render.</p>
<p>At all other points on the &ldquo;meridian of local noon&rdquo;, the Sun will be to the north or south depending on whether you are to the south or the north of the subsolar point. Any object will cast a shadow in the north-south direction even at local noon.</p>
<h2 id="latitudes-where-zero-shadow-is-observed">Latitudes where Zero Shadow is observed</h2>
<p>The Earth rotates about its axis and revolves around the Sun. If the Earth&rsquo;s axis was perpendicular to the plane of Earth&rsquo;s orbit, then at any given time, the location on Earth closest to the Sun would lie on the Equator. Only places on the equator would experience Zero Shadow (and they would do so everyday) and no other latitude would ever experience the Zero Shadow effect.</p>
<p>However, Earth&rsquo;s axis is not perpendicular to plane of Earth&rsquo;s orbit. Earth&rsquo;s axis makes an angle of 23.5 degrees with the plane of Earth&rsquo;s orbit. Because of this, the latitude of the subsolar point moves between 23.5 degrees north and 23.5 degrees south through the course of a year. These latitudes are also known as Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn respectively.</p>
<p>On the summer solstice (June 21), the subsolar point lies on the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees north), and on the winter solstice (December 21), the subsolar point lies on the Tropic of Capricorn (23.5 degrees south). Throughout the rest of the year, the latitude of Zero Shadow moves between the tropics.</p>
<p>The day when Zero Shadow is observed at a place is called &ldquo;Zero Shadow Day&rdquo;.
All places that lie between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn experience Zero Shadow Day twice a year.
The tropics observe Zero Shadow Day only once a year. The Tropic of Cancer sees Zero Shadow Day on the summer solstice and the Tropic of Capricorn sees it on the winter solstice.
Places outside the tropics never observe Zero Shadow Day as the Sun can never be overhead those places.</p>
<h3 id="zero-shadow-day-in-mumbai">Zero Shadow Day in Mumbai</h3>
<p>I stay in Mumbai, which is at latitude \(19.1^{\circ} \text{N} \). At this latitude, the Zero Shadow Days are 15 May and 28 August.
Around local noon, (which happens to be around 12.20 PM), if it is sunny, we will get to experience Zero Shadow.</p>
<p>It usually rains in Mumbai in August. The sky is covered with grey clouds which diffuse the sunlight, and objects don&rsquo;t have distinct shadows. In a way, this is also &ldquo;Zero Shadow&rdquo;, but there is no interesting astronomical phenomenon at play here.</p>

<p>Actually, the Earth rotates slightly more than 360 degrees in 24 hours. It completes a full rotation in roughly 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds. However, since the Earth is also orbiting the sun, it needs to rotate a bit more for the sun to be overhead again.

<![CDATA[<img src="https://pranshugaba.com/recipes/starfruit-sandwich/starfuit_sandwich_featured_hu_3048add6597cd711.webp" alt="Tomato and starfruit slices placed on a slice of bread." /><p>One day, many moons ago, I went out in Bangalore for a long walk and bought an assortment of groceries from different parts of the city: Organic spinach bread, starfruits, tomatoes, cheese cubes, rock salt, and a knife.</p>
<p>When I returned to my room, I tried to make a sandwich from what I had bought. The result: A delicious juicy sandwich with a variety of tastes and textures that is also easy to make.</p>
<p>The following recipe makes one sandwich. Two or three such sandwiches would make a meal.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 slices of sliced bread (preferably spinach bread)</li>
<li>1 starfruit</li>
<li>1 tomato</li>
<li>1 cheese cube of 20g</li>
<li>Rock salt</li>
<li>Pringles (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut a tomato into two halves. Cut one half into four slices. Keep the other half aside.</li>
<li>Arrange the tomato slices on a slice of bread.</li>
<li>Sprinkle some rock salt on the tomato slices.</li>
<li>Cut a starfruit into thin slices.</li>
<li>Place five starfruit slices in the shape of a star on the tomatoes. Keep the remaining slices aside.

</li>
<li>Enjoy your starfruit sandwich! Intersperse with bites of tomato, starfruit, and cheese that you had kept aside.
Optionally, consume some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic paraboloid potato-based crisps</a> on the side.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starfruit seeds are soft and are easily cut with a knife. Inspect the starfruit slices closely and make sure that you remove all seed fragments from the slices. A starfruit typically has 4-6 seeds in it.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have spinach bread, you may use whole wheat bread or multigrain bread instead. You can apply some mint chutney to the bread slices to make it tastier.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have starfruit available, you may use a cucumber instead. However, this is not as much fun.</li>

<![CDATA[<p>Most research talks are being held online post lockdown, and as a result, one can access talks from all over the world.
I came across a website that lists upcoming research seminars and makes it easier to discover interesting talks.</p>
<p><a href="https://researchseminars.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://researchseminars.org/</a></p>
<p>This website was launched in April 2020 shortly after lockdown began.
It lists upcoming talks and seminars held in universities all over the world.
You can filter talks by topic, language, institution, and more.</p>

<p>For each talk, the site shows details such as the title, abstract, speaker, the targeted audience, and a link to the seminar&rsquo;s website.
Most talks have a livestream link available (either interactive like Zoom / Google Meet / Microsoft Teams or viewing only such as Youtube).
Links for some talks are not be available unless you register on this site.</p>
<p>Try to attend and participate in talks that pique your interest. The feeling of being able to attend a talk held halfway across the world is unmatched.</p>

	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>If you are not familiar with the rules of chess, then you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_chess" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the rules on Wikipedia</a> or <a href="https://lichess.org/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">practice playing on lichess.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>You are organising a chess tournament.
The games had just started when the clock struck one, and all players promptly left their games and headed for lunch! When they returned, they found to their dismay, they had all forgotten whose turn it was to play.
Can you help them out?</p>
<p>For each game, you know only the positions of the pieces and nothing else. From this information alone, you need to decide whether it&rsquo;s White or Black to play next.
You may assume that the players have been playing legal chess moves, but not necessarily optimal ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this even possible?&rdquo;, you ask.
Does a chess position have the information required to deduce which player plays next?  This is what you will try to reason out.</p>
<p>For each of the following games, find which one of the following statements holds:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be White&rsquo;s turn to play</li>
<li>It must be Black&rsquo;s turn to play</li>
<li>It could be either White or Black to play</li>
<li>It is an impossible position. (i.e. One cannot reach this position by playing legal moves only. Someone might have disturbed the board.)</li>
</ul>

<figcaption>All pieces are in the initial position.</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>It might be the case that the game hasn&rsquo;t started, which would mean that it could be White to move.
It remains to be answered if this position could be Black to move.</p>
<p>Could it be the case that the players played some moves and then arrived back at this initial position?
If not, then we are done. Otherwise, we need to find out if there exists a sequence of moves that results in this position with Black to move.</p>
<h3 id="game-2">Game 2</h3>
<p>Something&rsquo;s up with the knights&hellip; They seem to have switched places.  Whose turn is it to play?</p>

        Hint 1
    </summary>
	<div class="admonition__content flow">
        <p>Given a chess position, how do we show that it&rsquo;s White&rsquo;s turn to play next?
We must show that for all sequences of legal moves that result in the given position, the last move of the sequence must have been played by Black. That would mean that it&rsquo;s White to move in the given position. Moreover, we must also show that at least one such sequence exists.</p>
<p>Showing that a position is Black to play uses similar reasoning.</p>
<p>How do we show that a position could be either White to move or Black to move? This case is simpler. It is sufficient to show two sequences of legal moves that result in the given position: one ending with a move played by White, and the other ending with a move by Black. There&rsquo;s no way of knowing from the position alone which player must play next, and therefore, the position could be either White or Black to play in the game.</p>
<p>Some positions are impossible in chess. That is, there does not exist any sequence of legal moves that result in the position. To show that a position is impossible, we must show exactly this: There does not exist any sequence of legal moves that results in the position.</p>

<details class="admonition hint-2 ">
    <summary class="admonition__title">
        Hint 2
    </summary>
	<div class="admonition__content flow">
        <p>At any point of time in a game, look at the parities of the number of moves played by White and the number of moves played by Black. What does it mean if both are odd? What happens when one is odd and one is even?</p>

    </div>
</details>
<h2 id="generalisation">Generalisation</h2>
<p>Try to come up with a fast algorithm that, given a position, decides whether the position is White to play, Black to play, either, or none.</p>
<p>You could begin by finding a simple characterization for positions that must be White to play.  What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a position to necessarily be White to play?</p>
<p>It might help if you try out more chess positions.
If you have access to a physical chess board, that&rsquo;s great! Otherwise, you can play with the board online on the <a href="https://lichess.org/editor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lichess board editor</a>.</p>

&lt;p>I foolishly tried to fight the guy near the bonfire in Lordran and he killed me almost immediately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I respawned, and he was still trying to kill me. I jumped off a cliff, and so did he. I respawned, but he did not :)&lt;/p>

<![CDATA[<p>Today, I updated my system running Arch Linux after a month using <code>pacman -Syu</code>. I rebooted my system to find a black screen instead of the SDDM login screen. I tried pressing the Caps Lock key, and I could see its light toggle. This meant that things were not that bad.</p>
<p>I changed the tty using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> and logged in to my system. I tried downgrading the Linux kernel but that didn&rsquo;t help. I tried disabling the optimus-manager and sddm services, and tried starting the Xorg server using <code>startx</code> or <code>xinit</code>. None of this worked.</p>
<p>The fix was to rebuild the optimus-manager package. It turns out that Python was upgraded from 3.9 to 3.10 in the update, and this broke Optimus Manager. I rebuilt it, and I am able to access the login screen and my window manager again.</p>
<p>I could see that some of my AUR packages were still built using older versions of Python using this command:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I rebuilt all those packages to use the latest Python version.
I also finally installed <code>yay</code> to manage all my AUR packages.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>December is here, which means it&rsquo;s problem solving season!</p>
<h2 id="maths">Maths</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew Scroggs</a> has posted the seventh edition of the <a href="https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/blog/91" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent calendar of maths puzzles</a> on his blog. A new puzzle is unlocked everyday, and you have until the end of the year to submit the answers. The first twenty-four puzzles each have a three digit solutions, and these solutions form the clues required to solve the main puzzle on the 25th.
Ten people who solve all puzzles correctly are randomly selected to win a T-shirt!</p>
<p>The problems are mostly from number theory and combinatorics, which are coincidentally two of my favourite areas of mathematics. I believe most people would find the problems interesting and challenging. I have solved the last three editions of this advent, and plan to solve it this year as well.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>This year, we get the seventh <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code</a> by <a href="http://was.tl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eric Wastl</a>. Two programming puzzles are unlocked every day.
Solving these puzzles requires basic programming skills, but more importantly, critical thinking skills.
You are free to use any programming language to solve them. You can even use pen and paper, although I would not recommend it.
I recently started learning the functional programming language Haskell, and I am using it to solve these puzzles. I am loving the experience so far.</p>

<p>If you know any other puzzles happening in December (or any other time of the year really), <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/contact/">let me know</a>!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I want to cycle more in South Mumbai, so I needed to get my cycle from my home to TIFR. I could have gone by train, but cycling is more fun!</p>
<p>It was an exciting but exhausting ride. I left at 5.20 am and reached TIFR at 8.35 am. I mainly cycled along S V road and Dr. Annie Besant road.</p>
<p>I got to see a rainbow on the way!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I have my qualifier exams tomorrow, and my pen is almost out of ink. I wanted to buy a refill, but the general store in TIFR does not stock refills for the pen that I use. So I decided to walk to a stationery store in Colaba market and buy a refill.</p>
<p>The nearest stationery store is 3 kilometres from TIFR, and a round trip to the store would have been just over 6 kilometres. However, I felt like doing some sightseeing, and I ended up walking more than 14 kilometres.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the route that I walked and some pictures that I took. It&rsquo;s mostly cats and buildings, but there&rsquo;s also a dog and some reptiles.</p>

<![CDATA[<img src="https://pranshugaba.com/trips/a-new-cycle/decathlon_featured_hu_61b9f0499c3d3582.jpg" alt="My new silver Triban road bike" /><p>I ordered a road bike online from Decathlon, and it was available for pickup from their store in Bandra. Given the lovely cloudy July weather, I decided to cycle back home to Kandivali.</p>
<p>I tried to avoid the main roads &mdash; using parallel roads that were less busy instead. I got lost in Versova once, and had to backtrack for a bit.
As a result, I ended up cycling 27 kilometres, even though Bandra is only 18 kilometres away from my home.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the route that I took, as well as some interesting photos I clicked on the way.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>I was writing a <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/moving-back-to-hugo/">post about my new Hugo website</a>, and I wanted to describe the colours used on this site. I wrote the names of the colours, but names do not convey the colour very well. Can you imagine what the colour #714825 looks like? What about rgb(0, 100, 255)?</p>
<p>I thought it would be great if the reader could also see a preview of the colours. I could add images of the colours that I am describing, but that is a lot of work and not very flexible.  This is what led me to write this Hugo shortcode. I followed the <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo docs on shortcodes</a> for reference.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The following code in markdown
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">This is a colour shortcode {{&lt; colour &#34;#ff0000&#34; &gt;}}.</span></span></code></pre></div></p>
<p>renders as</p>
<p>This is a colour shortcode 
<code style="background-color: #ff0000;"> 
<span style="color: #ff0000;filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">#ff0000</span></code>.</p>
<p>This works with all valid CSS colour syntaxes, not just hexcodes. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code style="background-color: #714285;"> 
<span style="color: #714285;filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">#714285</span></code></li>
<li>
<code style="background-color: rgb(0, 100, 255);"> 
<span style="color: rgb(0, 100, 255);filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">rgb(0, 100, 255)</span></code></li>
<li>
<code style="background-color: hsl(37.1, 100%, 91.8%);"> 
<span style="color: hsl(37.1, 100%, 91.8%);filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">hsl(37.1, 100%, 91.8%)</span></code></li>
<li>
<code style="background-color: aquamarine;"> 
<span style="color: aquamarine;filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">aquamarine</span></code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shortcode">Shortcode</h2>
<p>I created a file named <code>colour.html</code> in <code>layouts/shortcodes</code>, and added the following code in it. We can now access this code in any markdown file using the <code>colour</code> shortcode.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$</span><span class="nx">colour</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Get</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">safeCSS</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span><span class="w">

</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nx">span</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">style</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s">&#34;
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s">      color: {{ $colour }};
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s">      filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="s">      &#34;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">      </span><span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$</span><span class="nx">colour</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="w">  </span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">span</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">code</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="w">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>The shortcode takes in an argument: <code>$colour</code>.  We use this parameter to set the text in the <code>code</code> tag, and we set both the text colour and the background colour to <code>$colour</code>. We then invert the colour of the text and increase the contrast to make the name of the colour legible. The end result is that the text is white if colour is bright, and black if it is dark.</p>



<aside class="admonition note">
    <div class="admonition__title">
        Note
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>While the shortcode syntax is specific to Hugo, most templating languages have a way to pass in variables. It should be possible to adapt this code for the templating language that you use.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>This works well in most cases, but it has some limitations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the luminosity of the colour is close to 50% and the saturation is low, neither black nor white text has enough contrast with the chosen colour, and the text is not as legible. Example: 
<code style="background-color: hsl(180, 10%,  50%);"> 
<span style="color: hsl(180, 10%,  50%);filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">hsl(180, 10%,  50%)</span></code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The text is not legible when the colour is transparent. This is because the text is transparent too, and does not have enough contrast with the background. Example: 
<code style="background-color: rgba(120, 0, 240, 0.3);"> 
<span style="color: rgba(120, 0, 240, 0.3);filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">rgba(120, 0, 240, 0.3)</span></code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="alternate-style">Alternate style</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another style of previewing colours.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>
<span
    style="display: inline-block;
    width: 1.6ch;
    height: 1.6ch;
    border-radius: 0.1rem;
    background-color: #714285;
    margin-right:5px;"
    ></span>#714285</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>
<span
    style="display: inline-block;
    width: 1.6ch;
    height: 1.6ch;
    border-radius: 0.1rem;
    background-color: rgb(0, 100, 255);
    margin-right:5px;"
    ></span>rgb(0, 100, 255)</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>
<span
    style="display: inline-block;
    width: 1.6ch;
    height: 1.6ch;
    border-radius: 0.1rem;
    background-color: hsl(37.1, 100%, 91.8%);
    margin-right:5px;"
    ></span>hsl(37.1, 100%, 91.8%)</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>
<span
    style="display: inline-block;
    width: 1.6ch;
    height: 1.6ch;
    border-radius: 0.1rem;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    margin-right:5px;"
    ></span>aquamarine</code>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The text is always legible, but the colour preview is smaller.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the shortcode for this style:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">$</span><span class="nx">colour</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">:=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Get</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">safeCSS</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span><span class="w">

<![CDATA[<p>Not more than 2 months ago, I had migrated my site from Hugo to Nuxt, and I had <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/moving-from-hugo-to-nuxt/">written a post</a> describing why I chose to do so. Well, that didn&rsquo;t last long, and now I am back to using Hugo.</p>
<h2 id="my-short-experience-with-nuxt">My (short) experience with Nuxt</h2>
<p>I had added many features to my site in Nuxt. I was happy with my progress; my site looked so pretty and colourful!</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TailwindCSS</a> to style my site, and it was amazing not having to think of class names anymore. It was easy to prototype and iterate over different styles quickly, even if it meant having a dirty HTML code overriden with dozens of classes.</p>
<p>Another thing I loved about Nuxt is that it is based on Vue, and therefore I could make reusable components for different parts of my site. Almost everything on my site was a component: header, footer, links, figures, headings, author bios, pagination, even the dark mode switch. To make my website, I had to design the components and then assemble them together, just like Lego! It was so much fun.</p>

<p>Once I finished adding features to my site, I wrote a tutorial on game development: <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/">Building an X and O game in Godot</a>. It was a long article &ndash; about 7000 words long &ndash; and it was filled with notes, figures, and codefences. With a post this big, I was beginning to face performance issues.</p>
<p>The site was taking too long to build. The initial build of the site would take more than 17 seconds to complete, and the server would take up about 1.5 GB of memory. I found out that one of the main offenders was Tailwind. I switched Tailwind to JIT mode, and the startup build time reduced to 6 seconds. But this increased again as I added custom styling.</p>
<p>I could live with the long build times, but I also noticed issues on my website, especially on mobile. I had a dark theme toggler in my website, and toggling the theme on mobile was taking a good second or two, and was causing frame drops.</p>
<p>Another issue I was facing was related to prefetching. As I have mentioned before, Nuxt prefetches links, so when you click on an link, the page appears to load almost instantly. While the page was loading very quickly, it did not load completely rendered. A lot of content loaded after a while as the components hydrated. This was causing layout shifts, which was annoying, distracting, and terrible experience for the user. I would rather the page take half a second to load, but it loads completely without any layout shift.</p>
<p>Yet another issue with using generators such as Next and Nuxt is that the first time a user visits my site, they have to download a big Javascript bundle. This greatly increases the total blocking time and the time to Largest Contentful Paint during a user&rsquo;s first visit, which is arguably the most important visit.</p>
<p>I was missing the simplicity and speed of Hugo, so I decided to give Hugo another go.</p>
<h2 id="my-new-site-built-with-hugo">My new site built with Hugo</h2>
<p>I had a not-so-great experience with a readymade theme before, so this time I decided to write my own theme. I decided I would keep my site simple so it is easy to maintain and not too distracting to look at.</p>
<p>My site uses only two colours: 
<code style="background-color: papayawhip;"> 
<span style="color: papayawhip;filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">papayawhip</span></code> and 
<code style="background-color: #121212;"> 
<span style="color: #121212;filter:  grayscale(1) invert(1) contrast(100);">#121212</span></code>. Every element has one of these two colors. This makes the colour part of the CSS very simple, and I was also able to write the dark theme in no time.</p>
<p>I love this simple design; I think it looks crisp and clear with no distractions. The content is legible with enough contrast between the foreground and the background, much like a road sign.</p>

<figure class="small">
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/moving-back-to-hugo/road-sign.webp" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>I also love the creative decisions that I have to take when I have just two colours at my disposal. There are no box-shadows, no transparency, and no colour (except for images) on this site. Any component on the site must use exactly one of the two colours in the palette.</p>
<p>I am no longer using Tailwind to style the site; I am using <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sass</a> now. I do have to think of class names for each class, but using the BEM methodology helps. While Tailwind has most of the CSS features, it still lacks many newer CSS properties. I can now use all CSS properties now such as underline-offset, smooth scrolling, scroll-padding-top, etc.</p>
<p>In Sass, we can split our CSS into different modules to make it more organised and easy to maintain. We can combine the modules using the <code>@use</code> directive, or the deprecated <code>@import</code> directive. I wanted to use  <code>@use</code> instead of  <code>@import</code>,  but it is only available in Dart Sass, which Hugo does not support  as of writing.  So, what I do is I write in Dart Sass and live compile it. Hugo only gets the compiled CSS file.</p>
<p>While I can no longer use Vue components, Hugo has templates, partials, and shortcodes that help me avoid repeating code.</p>
<p>Performance wise, this site now scores perfectly on Lighthouse tests. It builds in ~150ms, which is really impressive.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>While Nuxt is powerful, it is too powerful for a simple site like mine which has just text and images. I feel Hugo is more than enough for my needs.</p>
<p>I like my stack now. It is boring, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. I have redesigned my site twice in the last three months, and have spent hardly any time writing content. I am done adding new features to this site now.  I might polish up the code and publish it as a theme on <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo themes</a>. Everything has been setup for me to write content and post it. I just need to start writing now.</p>
<p>I have moved my Nuxt website to the nuxt subdomain, and it will remain there for posterity. I won&rsquo;t be making any changes to it. I will publish new  posts on my new website only.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Do you love playing video games? I sure do! I enjoy making games too, and it&rsquo;s highly likely that you would too.
Game development is an umbrella term for ranging from designing levels, mechanics to coding the logic to making art and music.
It has a little something for everyone. If you would like to learn how to make games, then this guide is a great place to start, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will make an X and O game using Godot.
This is a great first game to make as it is not too complex, and yet it
covers many important aspects of game development.</p>
<p>We will look at some of the most important programming paradigms in game development.
We will learn how to make games using Godot.</p>
<p>There are no prerequisites, except for critical thinking, reasoning, and basic computer skills. Prior programming experience is helpful, but not necessary.
The goal of the guide is to get you comfortable with using Godot to build simple games.</p>
<p>By the end of this guide, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a gameplay loop for the game</li>
<li>Create a complete working game
<ul>
<li>Display images and text in the game</li>
<li>Keep track of the state of the game</li>
<li>Listen for clicks in an area</li>
<li>Detect and respond to keyboard presses</li>
<li>Create, emit, and connect signals</li>
<li>Decide and check win conditions of a game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Export your game and share it with others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-godot">About Godot</h3>
<p>We will use Godot &ndash; an amazing game engine &ndash; to make our game.
A game engine is software that handles and integrates various aspects of game development: graphics, physics, logic, sound, interface, input, and more.
Some other popular game engines are Unity and Unreal.
I will describe some advantages that Godot has over them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Godot is free and open-source.
You can visit <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot&rsquo;s GitHub page</a> and look at Godot&rsquo;s source code. You can study how it&rsquo;s made and how it works.
You can report bugs and contribute to the codebase yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any game that you make using Godot belongs to you, and any profit you make is yours to keep. This is not the case with most other game engines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Godot works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. In particular, Godot has first-class support for
Linux. Since I primarily use Linux, this is perfect for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Godot is lightweight. Godot is only a 35 MB download, it starts up in seconds, and is very light on CPU and memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Godot is a joy to use. The UI is simple and shows you only what you need to see, allowing you to focus on your work. It is also customisable: you can change the colour scheme and the fonts of the editor as you please.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download Godot for free from <a href="https://godotengine.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot&rsquo;s website</a>. We will write code in GDScript and not C#, so we do not need the Mono version. Select
your operating system, download the Standard version, and extract
and run!</p>

        Aside
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>btw, I use arch.  If you use Arch Linux, installing Godot is even easier.  Just <code>pacman -S godot</code>!</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>This guide uses Godot 3.3.2, the latest stable version available at the time
of writing. Godot tries to maintain backward compatibility, so this guide should work for future versions of Godot 3 as well.</p>
<p>The complete code of the finished version of the game is available on my GitHub page.
If you face any issue, if something&rsquo;s not working, you can compare your code with it.
You can also play the final version game to see how it works on my itch.io page.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="setting-things-up">Setting things up</h2>
<h3 id="planning-the-game">Planning the game</h3>
<p>Before we start any work on a game in Godot, it is important to plan out how the game would look and behave. Having a concrete picture of the game in mind will help us when we develop the game in Godot.</p>
<p>Here are some helpful questions that we can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the genre/theme of the game?</li>
<li>What is the name of the game?</li>
<li>How many players can play the game? (single-player or multiplayer)</li>
<li>What are the objectives of the game?</li>
<li>What device will it be played on?</li>
<li>How does the user interact with the game?</li>
<li>How does the user interface look like?</li>
<li>What happens in a typical gameplay?</li>
<li>How long does a gameplay session last?</li>
</ul>
<p>This list isn&rsquo;t exhaustive, but it gets you thinking about most major details of the game. The answers to these questions will directly impact the decisions you take when you develop the game. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The theme of the game will affect the choice of your art, sound, and music.</li>
<li>A multiplayer game will have different input systems and networking requirements compared to a single-player game.</li>
<li>Games developed for mobile will have a different interface compared to games developed for desktop.</li>
</ul>



<aside class="admonition note">
    <div class="admonition__title">
        Note
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>Of course, the answers to these questions are not fixed; they will most likely change as you work on the game. As you build the game and test it, you might find that a feature you had planned doesn&rsquo;t do well in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might come up with a better alternative during development.</li>
<li>Your idea might be too complex to explain to the player.</li>
<li>It might not be as exciting as you thought it would be.</li>
<li>It might be hard to implement because of some technical limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be open to making changes to your game as you work on it.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>Let&rsquo;s answer these questions for our X and O game.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a puzzle game. It is bright and colourful.</li>
<li>We will call it &ldquo;X and O&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It is played by two players.</li>
<li>The objective of the player is to place three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>
<li>It can be played on desktop.</li>
<li>The player clicks on the squares to enter symbols.</li>
<li>I have made a rough sketch how the interface would look like. This will be a simple game with just one scene. In more complex games, we would need more scenes.

  <figure class="diagram">

              We have the game title, some instructions, the grid, and some labels to show whose turn it is to play.
              
              
              
          
      </figcaption>
      
  </figure>
  
</li>
<li>We will describe the gameplay loop using a flowchart. It will also tell us how long a session will last.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-gameplay-loop">The gameplay loop</h3>
<p>We want to write down how the state of the game changes as the player plays the game.
We want to explicitly state how the game receives inputs, what decisions it takes, what changes it makes, and how all of these relate to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X and O&rdquo; is a small and simple game, so its gameplay loop is simple too.</p>

<figure class="diagram">
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/gameloop.png" alt="The gameplay loop">

    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the game starts, we listen for clicks on the grid.</li>
<li>When the player clicks on a cell, we show the appropriate symbol in that cell.</li>
<li>We then compute if someone has won. If not, then we check if the game has drawn.</li>
<li>If the game has ended (by a win or a draw), then we display the name of the winner and give an option to start a new game. Otherwise, we go back to listening for clicks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each round of the game lasts no more than a minute. Players may play multiple rounds in a session.</p>
<p>Now that we have a good picture of how the game would work, we are ready to start working in Godot.</p>
<h3 id="project-setup">Project setup</h3>
<p>Open Godot and create a new project. We will call it <code>x-and-o</code>. Choose an empty folder to save the project in, preferably with the same name as the game.
Select &ldquo;Create &amp; Edit&rdquo; to create the project.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/create-project.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>By default, when we start a new project, Godot starts in 3D mode. We are making a 2D game, so switch to 2D mode by clicking on &ldquo;2D&rdquo; at the top. The default shortcut to enter 2D mode is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd>.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/2d-mode.png" alt="Click on 2D.">

            Click on 2D.
            
            
            
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Screens come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are square, some are tall, some are wide.
We want our game to render correctly on all screens.
Since this is our first game, we will keep it simple.
We will target a fixed resolution, so we do not have to worry about making the layout responsive.</p>
<p>To achieve this, open Project -&gt; Project Settings.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/project-settings-menu.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>In the General tab, look for the section named &ldquo;Window&rdquo; in &ldquo;Display&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>Width</code> to <code>1280</code> and <code>Height</code> to <code>720</code>. This sets the aspect ratio of the game to 16:9, the most common aspect ratio for screens.</li>
<li>In the same section, scroll down to &ldquo;Stretch&rdquo;, and set <code>Mode</code> to <code>2d</code> and <code>Aspect</code> to <code>keep</code>. Now, if the aspect ratio of the screen is not 16:9, then Godot will not distort the content. It will pad the content with black bars instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way our game looks reasonably good on all screens with minimal effort. We will learn how to make a responsive layout another time.</p>
<p>By default, the background colour of the game is dark grey. Let&rsquo;s change the background colour. In the same &ldquo;General&rdquo; tab of project settings, go to Rendering -&gt; Environment -&gt; Default Clear Colour.
As mentioned before, I want the game to be bright and colourful.
I set it to <code>#ffffff</code>, which is the hex code for white. Feel free to choose a colour that goes with your theme.</p>
<h3 id="importing-assets">Importing assets</h3>
<p>Looking at the sketch interface, we see that we need to display some X&rsquo;s, some O&rsquo;s, and the grid on the screen.
We would load the images for these in Godot.
We show some text in our game, and we will need to load a nice font for it.</p>
<p>I have made an assets folder that you can use to make the game. It contains <code>x.png</code>, <code>o.png</code>, <code>grid.png</code>, and <code>Inter-Regular.ttf</code>.
You can <NavExtLink to="/">download my assets</NavExtLink>, or you can make your own.</p>

    </div>

<p>I have included the <code>Inter</code> font in the assets. I chose this font because it looks sharp even at low resolutions and it goes well with the &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo; sprites that I have made. You can use any font that goes with your theme.</p>

Make an <code>assets</code> folder in your game&rsquo;s root folder <code>x-and-o</code> using your file manager. (Use File Explorer if you are using Windows, Finder if you are on macOS). Move the sprites and the font in it.
When you open Godot, you will see those files in the FileSystem tab.</p>

<h2 id="building-the-interface">Building the interface</h2>
<p>We have imported all the resources that we need in Godot. We can now start building the user interface.</p>
<p>Whether we want to display an image, play a sound, or display some text in Godot, we do so by adding a node for it. A Godot game is made by composing together different kinds of nodes.</p>

Click on <code>Create root node</code> -&gt; <code>2D node</code> in the Scene tab. This will create a root node named <code>Node2D</code>. Rename it to <code>Game</code>.</p>

<p>Now that we have a root node, we can save the scene and run the game. Save the scene by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
Make a <code>scenes</code> folder in the root directory and save this scene in it as <code>Game.tscn</code>.</p>

<p>Run the game by clicking the play button (or press <kbd>F5</kbd>). The first time you run the game, Godot will ask you to set the main scene. The main scene is the scene that loads when you run the game. Select the <code>Game.tscn</code> scene we just saved.</p>

<p>Of course, we haven&rsquo;t added anything to our scene yet, so we only see a blank screen when the game is run.
Close the window (or press <kbd>F8</kbd>) to stop the preview.</p>
<p>We look to our sketch to help us build the interface. We need a grid, some X&rsquo;s, some O&rsquo;s, and some text labels.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the labels because they are simpler.</p>
<h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
<p>We can display text in a game with a <code>Label</code> node. Select <code>Game</code> and click on the plus icon to add a child node. In the &ldquo;Create New Node&rdquo; dialog that appears, search for <code>Label</code>, and click on &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</p>

<figure >

        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/label-node.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>A <code>Label</code> node appears as a child of <code>Game</code> in the scene tab.
Rename the name of this node to <code>GameName</code> because that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/scene-tree-gamename.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>We do not see any change in our game because the label has no text. We can add/edit the text of the <code>Label</code> by editing the <code>Text</code> property in the inspector tab. This label will display the name of the game: &ldquo;X and O&rdquo;. Change the text of the label to &ldquo;X and O&rdquo;.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>The label is hard to read: it is small and is white on a white background. We will fix this by using a custom font.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>In the inspector tab, in <code>Custom Fonts</code>, enable the Font property. Click on Empty -&gt; New DynamicFont.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Click on &ldquo;Dynamic Font&rdquo; to show some additional settings. In Font -&gt; Font Data, click on Empty -&gt; Load and select your font file. We can adjust the font size in <code>Settings</code>. We would like the name of the game to be big, so I set the font size to <code>96</code>. We can also change the font colours in Custom Colours -&gt; Font colours. Play with the parameters until you have happy with the appearance.</p>

</figure>


<p>We have three more labels to show in our interface. Repeat this process three times to end up with a total of four labels.
I made three new <code>Label</code> nodes with names <code>WinCondition</code>, <code>PlayerTurn</code>, and <code>PlayerInstruction</code>. My game looks like this now.</p>

</aside>
<p>Our text looks good. Next, we will add the grid.</p>
<h3 id="the-grid">The Grid</h3>
<p>The grid is a bit more complex. In addition to showing the grid, we also need to listen for clicks and display an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or &ldquo;O&rdquo; in each of the nine cells.</p>
<p>Create a 2D node and name it <code>Grid</code>. We will store all nodes related to the grid as children of this node. This will make our <code>Game</code> scene more organised.</p>
<p>We can show images in Godot using the <code>Sprite</code> node.
Add a child node to <code>Grid</code> of type <code>Sprite</code>, and rename the node to <code>GridSprite</code>.
We do not see any change in our game because the sprite does not have a texture. Drag and drop <code>grid.png</code> from the FileSystem to the <code>Texture</code> property of the sprite.</p>
<p>We can see the grid in our game now, but it&rsquo;s too big for our screen. We need to scale it down.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/large-grid.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>In <code>GridSprite</code>, in transform, set the Scale to <code>0.3</code> and <code>0.3</code>.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/scale-grid.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>The grid fits in the screen now.</p>

        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/correct-grid.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>We want to be able to detect clicks.
We can detect clicks in an area using the <code>Area2D</code> node. We will have nine <code>Area2D</code> nodes, one for each cell of the grid.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s add one <code>Area2D</code> node as a child of <code>Grid</code>, and rename it to <code>GridCell</code>. This gives
a yellow warning symbol. Hover over it, and it tells us to add a <code>CollisionShape2D</code> as a child.
We get this warning because we have an <code>Area2D</code> node, but we haven&rsquo;t defined its area. Add a <code>CollisionShape2D</code> as a child of <code>GridCell</code> to remove this warning.</p>
<p>The <code>CollisionShape2D</code> now shows a warning: it needs a shape to function. Our cells are squares, so we select New RectangleShape2D in the inspector tab.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/new-rectangle-2d.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Resize and move the blue area so it covers one of the grid cells.
Using Grid Snap will make it easier to fit the CollisionShape2D on the cell perfectly.</p>

<figure >

        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/collision-shape.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>We would like to show &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo; symbols in the cells when the game is played. Recall that we show images using the <code>Sprite</code> node.
Add a <code>Sprite</code> as a child of <code>GridCell</code>, and rename it to <code>CellSymbol</code>. Choose the texture as <code>x.png</code>. If you are using my assets, you will need to scale it to <code>0.3</code> and translate it by <code>96</code> and <code>96</code> to centre the image in the cell.</p>
<p>Our <code>GridCell</code> node is ready. We could duplicate it nine times and our game would work.
However, if we want to make any changes to this node in the future, we would have to apply the changes on all nine nodes. This is tedious at best, and a source for errors at worst.</p>
<p>We solve this problem by saving the <code>GridCell</code> node as a scene. Then, anytime we want to use this node, we can create an instance of it. Any changes that we make to the <code>GridCell</code> scene will be reflected in all of its instances.</p>
<p>To save the node as a scene, right-click on the node in the Scene tab, select &ldquo;Save Branch as Scene&rdquo;, and save it as <code>GridCell.tscn</code> in the <code>scenes</code> folder.</p>
<p>The <code>GridCell</code> node has changed to an instance of the scene. You can see the new button now. Click on the &ldquo;Open in Editor&rdquo; button to edit it.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Duplicate the node nine times. Move the nodes so we have one in each grid. Make sure to arrange them in order, because we will refer to them later when we want to detect win conditions. Also, rename <code>GridCell</code> to <code>GridCell1</code> for consistency.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/nine-gridcells.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>The texture that we set in the sprite in <code>GridCell</code> appears nine times in the grid. If we change the texture of the sprite in the <code>GridCell</code> scene, say to <code>x.png</code>, then observe that the sprite of every cell in the grid changes to an &ldquo;X&rdquo;.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/grid-complete.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Since we start the game with the empty grid, we don&rsquo;t want any of the X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s to show initially. We will show them one by one, programmatically, when the players play the game. For now, remove the texture from the <code>CellSymbol</code> sprite in <code>GridCell</code> to get an empty grid.</p>
<p>We have added all the nodes needed to make the game, but the game is still static and doesn&rsquo;t do much.
We will now add the code to make it dynamic and interactive.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-the-logic">Implementing the logic</h2>
<p>We control the behaviour of nodes using scripting. Godot officially supports 4 languages for scripts: GDScript, VisualScript, C#, and C++. You can read more about them in <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scripting docs</a></p>
<p>We will write our scripts in GDScript. Its syntax is similar to Python.
You can read the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot Docs for GDScript</a> for more information about GDScript.</p>
<p>Click on the Attach Script button to attach a script to the <code>Game</code> node.</p>

<figure >

<p>This shows the &ldquo;Attach Script dialog&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The default options are fine, click &ldquo;Create&rdquo;. This will create a file named <code>Game.gd</code>. This is where will write the logic for the game.

<p>The <code>_process</code> method is called every frame. Anything that must be done every frame goes in <code>_process</code>.

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the gameplay loop again. The game takes decisions based on the state of the game. We need a way to store the game&rsquo;s state.</p>
<h3 id="storing-the-state-of-the-game">Storing the state of the game</h3>
<p>What information would we like to save in a state? Given the state, we must be able to accurately make the decisions in our gameplay flowchart. We must be able to tell if someone has won, if the game has drawn or if it is still going on. In the last case, we must also be able to tell whose turn it is to play. We need to know the state of each cell in order to determine if someone has drawn or not.</p>
<p>We will save the following information in our state:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>game_started</code>: Is a game in progress? If yes, then we need to listen for clicks and check for wins and draws. Otherwise, we need to show a &ldquo;Start New Game&rdquo; button.</li>
<li><code>turns_played</code>: How many turns have been played so far? This value will help us check whether all cells have been filled, in which case the game has ended.</li>
<li><code>player_turn</code>: We would like to store whose turn it is to play now. We will use this to determine if the next click should add an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or an &ldquo;O&rdquo;. We will also display this information to the players.</li>
<li><code>cells</code>: For each cell in the grid, we need to store whether it is empty, has an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or an &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each property, we will declare the variable and initialise it.
We will declare the variables outside <code>_ready</code> so we can access them in other functions.
We will initialise our variables in <code>_ready</code>.</p>
<h4 id="game_started"><code>game_started</code></h4>
<p>This variable tells us if a game is in progress.
Once the scene is loaded, we are ready to play. We should begin listening for clicks and check for wins. We set <code>game_started</code> is <code>true</code> in <code>_ready</code>.</p>

<p>The variable <code>player_turn</code> will store the name of the player whose turn it is to play. While we can give these players any name we wish, let&rsquo;s call them player <code>1</code> and player <code>-1</code>.
This choice will make our work in the future easier.</p>
<p>Player <code>1</code> will play first and will place X&rsquo;s. Player <code>-1</code> will go second and will place O&rsquo;s.

<p>Let&rsquo;s write a function <code>change_player</code> function that changes the state of <code>player_turn</code>.
We need to care about the details of how we change the player in this function only. Then, any time we want to change the player, we can call <code>change_player</code> without having to know how it works.
This is called <NavExtLink to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</NavExtLink>, and helps keep our code organised.</p>
<p>Due to our choice of player names, this is function is a one-liner.</p>

<h4 id="cells"><code>cells</code></h4>
<p>We need to store the state of each cell in the grid.
The variable <code>cells</code> will be an array in which we store references to all <code>GridCell</code> nodes.
We store these in an array so we can access them easily.
We will be able to read/edit the properties of the nodes using these references.</p>
<p>We get a reference to a node using the <code>get_node</code> method. To access a node, we pass the path of the node relative to the current node (the node that the script is attached to) to <code>get_node</code>.</p>

<p>Since accessing nodes is a common pattern in Godot, there is a shorthand notation for it. We can write <code>$Grid/GridSprite</code> instead of <code>get_node(&quot;Grid/GridSprite&quot;)</code>. We will follow this shorter notation from now on.</p>

        <p>The Godot editor will help you autocomplete the name of the node as soon as you type the dollar symbol.
Make sure the node your script is attached to is active.</p>

<p>Once we have a reference to a node, we can manipulate it. Any changes that we can make in the Inspector tab, we can also make in our script. If you hover your mouse over any property in the inspector tab, you will see the name of the property that you can use in scripts.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to hide the <code>GridSprite</code> when the game starts, you can do the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">_ready</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you play the game now, the grid lines will not be visible.
This is how we can control nodes from our scripts.
(Let&rsquo;s undo this so the grid is visible when you play the game.)</p>
<p>Now that we know how to access the <code>GridCell</code> nodes, we might try something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">cells</span>

<p>Create a node of type <code>Node2D</code> in <code>Grid</code> and name it <code>GridCells</code>. Select all nine <code>GridCell</code> nodes and drag them on to <code>GridCells</code> to make them children of <code>GridCells</code>.
Now, all <code>GridCell</code> we want to access are children of <code>GridCells</code>.
We can call <code>$Grid/GridCells.get_children()</code> to get an array of references to the <code>GridCell</code> nodes.</p>
<p>We can delete the ten lines we added in <code>_ready</code> and add this one line in its place:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The resulting code is much cleaner.
We have references to each <code>GridCell</code> node. Now, we need to save information in each node. We use a script!</p>
<p>Attach a script to the <code>GridCell</code> scene.
This creates a script with the name <code>GridCell.gd</code>. Delete everything except the first line <code>extends Area2D</code>.</p>
<p>For each cell, we want to store if it is empty, or has an X or an O. Let&rsquo;s store this information in a variable named <code>value</code>.
Continuing our notation with the player names, a cell with an &ldquo;X&rdquo; has <code>value</code> equal to <code>1</code> and a cell with an &ldquo;O&rdquo; has <code>value</code> <code>-1</code>. Cells can also be empty. Let empty cells have <code>value</code> <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Declare the <code>value</code> variable in <code>GridCell.gd</code>:</p>

<p>As you have seen, signals are a very important concept in game development. We will now see how to implement this in Godot.</p>
<p>Nodes in Godot can emit signals when certain events occur.
Each node in Godot has some signals predefined in them. You can see the signals defined for any node by clicking on the Node tab next to the Inspector tab.</p>

<p>We can also make our own custom signals.

<p>Nodes can also listen for signals.
We want the <code>Game</code> node to listen for the <code>cell_clicked</code> signal emitted by a <code>GridCell</code> node.
We use the <code>connect</code> method to listen for signals. The syntax for connecting signals is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">SOURCE_NODE</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SIGNAL_NAME</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">TARGET_NODE</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">METHOD_NAME</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The way to read this is if when the <code>SOURCE_NODE</code> emits the <code>SIGNAL_NAME</code> signal, the <code>TARGET_NODE</code> calls the <code>METHOD_NAME</code> method. Let&rsquo;s see this in action for our game.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">_ready</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We want to listen for signals from every cell in the grid, so we have a <code>for</code> loop that iterates over all cells in the grid.
For each cell, when the <code>cell</code> node emits the <code>cell_clicked</code> signal, the <code>self</code> node (in this case the <code>Game</code> node) calls the <code>play_turn</code> method.</p>
<p>Great, we are almost done. We just need to fix the <code>if cell is clicked</code> statement in <code>GridCell.gd</code>.</p>
<p>How do we check if a cell is clicked? Godot has a predefined signal for it! We can use the <code>input_event</code> signal defined in nodes of type <code>Area2D</code>. If we hover over the name, we see that it is emitted when an input event occurs. What is an input event? We will investigate this soon. First, let&rsquo;s connect this signal.</p>
<p>We have seen how to connect signals using code. We can also use the GUI to connect signals in Godot. Let&rsquo;s see how to do that now.</p>
<p>Select the source node, the node that emits the signal. In our game, it&rsquo;s the <code>GridCell</code> node in the <code>GridCell</code> scene. It is of type <code>Area2D</code>. Open the Node tab, find the <code>input_event</code> signal and click ``Connect&hellip;&rsquo;'.</p>
<p>We must now select the target node, the node that listens for the signal.
We are listening for the signal in the <code>GridCell</code> node as well. This is a case where we connect a node to itself.</p>
<p>Also note the &ldquo;Receiver method&rdquo; field says <code>_on_GridCell_input_event</code>. This is the method that will be called in the target node when the signal is emitted.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code reads a lot like our description of the function. It is almost written in English.</p>
<p>Once a cell is clicked, we disconnect the signal to the node using the <code>disconnect</code> method.
We have introduced many new functions (that we haven&rsquo;t defined yet) to keep concerns separate and make the <code>play_turn</code> method easy to read.</p>
<p>The <code>check_win</code> method will return <code>true</code> if someone has won. In that case, we call the <code>game_over()</code> to clean things up, and <code>return</code> prevents the execution of the remainder of the <code>play_turn</code> method.</p>
<p>If <code>check_win</code> is false, then we check for draws with <code>check_draw</code>. This returns <code>true</code> if the game has drawn. Again, we call <code>game_over()</code> and <code>return</code> out of the <code>play_turn</code> method.</p>
<p>We will first work on <code>cell.setX</code>, <code>cell.setO</code>, and <code>cell.isEmpty</code>. Declare all other methods and write <code>pass</code> in their bodies for now. This suppresses the &ldquo;Method not declared&rdquo; errors while we work on the cell functions.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since the <code>setX</code> method is related to the cell, we will define it <code>setX</code> in <code>GridCell.gd</code>. This is also why we call it as <code>cell.setX()</code> in <code>Game.gd</code> and not just <code>setX</code>.</p>
<p>For each cell, we store a <code>value</code> and display a sprite.
When we set &ldquo;X&rdquo; in a cell, we must update the <code>value</code> of the cell and change the sprite shown in the cell.
Recall that <code>X</code> has <code>value</code> <code>1</code> and <code>O</code> has value <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>We can change the sprite shown by changing the texture of the <code>CellSymbol</code> node.
We load and access the textures in our scripts using the <code>preload</code> method.</p>

<p>The text labels are currently static.
We would like to update the labels after each turn. We would like to use the labels to tell the players whether it&rsquo;s &ldquo;X&rdquo; or &ldquo;O&rdquo; to play. Let&rsquo;s write the <code>update_labels</code> method now.</p>
<p>We want to show</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Player ___’s turn&rdquo; in the <code>PlayerTurn</code> label, and</li>
<li>&ldquo;Place an ___&rdquo; in the <code>PlayerInstruction</code> label.</li>
</ul>
<p>We add an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or an &ldquo;O&rdquo; in the blanks depending on whose turn it is. We can implement this in our script using format strings.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">player_turn_text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Player </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">&#39;s turn&#34;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This prints &ldquo;Player X&rsquo;s turn&rdquo; and &ldquo;Place an X&rdquo; in the output. The <code>%s</code> in the format strings is replaced by &ldquo;X&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo;, we will replace the <code>%s</code> in the format strings with a variable that depends on the value of <code>player_turn</code>. The variable will be equal to &ldquo;X&rdquo; if <code>player_turn</code> is equal to <code>1</code>, and it will be &ldquo;O&rdquo; if <code>player_turn</code> is <code>-1</code>.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have used a trick while writing the <code>player_symbols</code> array to make this work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays are counted starting with 0. Therefore, <code>player_symbols[1]</code> returns &ldquo;X&rdquo;.</li>
<li>We can access arrays from the end using negative indices. The <code>-1</code> index of an array is the last element of the array. Therefore, <code>player_symbols[-1]</code> returns &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</li>
<li>We can set the zeroeth element of the array to anything, as it will never be read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, when <code>update_labels</code> is called, it updates the labels with the correct text.</p>
<h3 id="checking-for-wins-and-draws">Checking for wins and draws</h3>
<p>If we play the game now, we can keep adding symbols until all cells have been filled. Even then, the labels say it&rsquo;s Player O&rsquo;s turn to play when clearly the game is over. We would like the game to stop once someone has won or the game has drawn, and we would like to display to result on the screen.</p>
<p>Display the name of the winner will be easier if we have a state variable that stores the name of the winner.
If no one has won yet, then <code>winner</code> stores <code>0</code>. Otherwise, it stores <code>1</code> or <code>-1</code> depending on who won.

<p>A player wins when they get three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
There are three rows, three columns, and two diagonals, so we need to check for three in a line in eight lines.</p>
<p>This is where choosing values <code>1</code> and <code>-1</code> for &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo; is useful again. To check if someone has won, we calculate the sum of values of each row, column, and diagonal. If any of them is 3 or -3, then we have a winner.</p>

<aside class="admonition note">
    <div class="admonition__title">
        Note
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>This post was published on an older version of my site. I have rewritten my site, and many things have changed since then. This site is no longer built using Nuxt.js, but the points that I make were valid at the time of writing this post.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>This site is built using Nuxt.js, and I have had a great time making it.
The previous version of this website (now retired to hugo.pranshugaba.com) was built using Hugo. In this post, I outline how I made the switch from Hugo to Nuxt. I hope this helps anyone who is looking to choose a static site generator for their website.</p>
<p>Hugo is quick to install and very easy to get started with, which is what drew me to it in the first place. There are a variety of user-submitted themes available, and out of those, the Academic theme was my favourite.</p>
<p>The theme has a lot of useful features, but I found it to be quite opinionated. I found several websites using this theme, and they all looked more or less the same. If I wanted to modify the theme, I had to override the theme templates, and in some cases rewrite them completely. This would often cause unintended effects. It was difficult to maintain the site, and even more so to add new features. I always felt that I had hacked it together and it could break with an update to Hugo or the theme.</p>
<p>I wanted to create a theme from scratch, and I realized that there is much more scope for customisation if I use frameworks such as React or Vue.</p>
<p>There are a lot of static site generators based on these frameworks. I tried out Gridsome, Next.js, and Nuxt.js.</p>
<h3 id="gridsome">Gridsome</h3>
<p>I tried <a href="https://gridsome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gridsome</a> first, which is based on Vue.js. I had only used plain HTML and CSS before, but I could pickup Vue easily because each Vue file is divided into <code>template</code>, <code>script</code>, and <code>style</code> tags corresponding to HTML, JS, and CSS respectively.</p>
<p>I enjoyed learning Gridsome, and I loved the site it generated too. Gridsome prefetches links, so links are super quick to open. It also automatically optimises image loading by showing a blurred placeholder in the place of the image until it loads.</p>
<p>I could access data from my markdown files using GraphQL. I had never used GraphQL before, and I enjoyed learning it.</p>
<h3 id="nextjs">Next.js</h3>
<p>Next, I tried out <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next.js</a> which uses React. I was surprised to see how easily I could pickup React since I knew Vue. Next.js has a great tutorial that teaches you Next.js by building a basic blog site. While I loved the tutorial, I didn&rsquo;t like the fact that I had to write so much code just to read my markdown files.</p>
<p>There were many features that I wanted to add to my website such as sitemap and PWA. I found many plugins for these on the <a href="https://github.com/unicodeveloper/awesome-nextjs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome-nextjs</a> page on GitHub. However, most of them were third-party, and you never know when they stop being supported.</p>
<h3 id="nuxtjs">Nuxt.js</h3>
<p>While browsing through the awesome-nextjs page, I discovered the <a href="https://github.com/nuxt-community/awesome-nuxt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">awesome-nuxtjs</a> page. I found that Nuxt has first-party modules for almost every feature that I would like in my site. I immediately switched to <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuxt.js</a>.
I found that Nuxt is in active development, the modules are great, and the documentation is detailed and well-written.</p>
<p>My favourite module is the <a href="https://content.nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuxt Content</a> module. It makes it very easy to access markdown files and their content. I also loved the <a href="https://sitemap.nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sitemap</a>, <a href="https://pwa.nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PWA</a>, and <a href="https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Mode</a> modules.</p>
<p>Like Gridsome and Next, Nuxt prefetches the outgoing links on any page, so the links begin to load even before you click on them. This makes the site feel fast and snappy!</p>
<p>I did the theming and styling from scratch and am adding features gradually. I was able to match all the features offered in Hugo, and then some.</p>
<h4 id="math-equations">Math equations</h4>
<p>Install <code>remark-math</code> and <code>rehype-katex</code> modules and we are good to go!</p>
<p>I can have inline math \(e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0\), and displaystyle math too!</p>
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
\]<h4 id="code-blocks">Code blocks</h4>

        Note
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>Recall how chess pieces move:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rooks move in straight lines up, down, left, or right.</li>
<li>Bishops can move diagonally.</li>
<li>Queens can move up, down, left, right, or diagonally.</li>
<li>Kings can move one step in any direction.</li>
<li>Pawns attack forward-left or forward-right.</li>
<li>Knight move in an L-shaped pattern. Two steps forward and one step sideways.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can practice the pieces&rsquo; movements on <a href="https://lichess.org/learn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lichess.org</a>.</p>

#1: The Picture Hanging Puzzle</title><link>https://pranshugaba.com/puzzles/1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Mar 2021 17:30:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pranshugaba.com/puzzles/1/</guid><description>
<![CDATA[<p>I will be sharing some interesting maths puzzles here, somewhat semiregularly. If you solve a puzzle &ndash; or make some progress &ndash; do  <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/contact/">share your attempt with me</a>. I would love to read your submissions. Interesting and enlightening reader-submitted solutions will be featured along with the following puzzle.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the first puzzle.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>You have stolen an exquisite painting from your local art gallery, and given the daring thief that you are, you would like to hang in your living room! You have with you some nails and a long rope.</p>
<h3 id="level-1">Level 1</h3>
<p>You would like to hang the painting using two nails. To allow for easy removal, you want the painting to fall if you remove any one of the nails from the wall.</p>
<p>Is this feat possible? If yes, then how would you hang the painting? If no, then prove that it is impossible.</p>



<aside class="admonition tip">
    <div class="admonition__title">
        Tip
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>Try it out with some pencils and a long string.</p>

    </div>
</aside>

<figure class="medium no-border">
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/puzzles/1/two_nails.png" alt="A painting hanging off two nails.">
    </picture>
    
    
    <figcaption>
        
            This method <em>does not</em> work, because if you remove any one nail, the painting still hangs from the other nail.
            
            
            
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<h3 id="level-2">Level 2</h3>
<p>Now suppose you want to hang the painting using \(n\) nails. You would like to painting to fall on removing any one nail.</p>
<p>For what values of \(n\) is this possible?
In the cases it is possible, how would you hang the painting?</p>
<h3 id="level-3">Level 3</h3>
<p>Suppose you want to hang the painting using \(n\) nails. This time, you would like the painting to fall on removing any \(m\) nails. The painting should not fall if you remove fewer than \(m\) nails.
You may assume \(1 \le m \le n\).</p>
<p>For what values of \(m\) and \(n\) is this possible?
In the cases it is possible, how would you go about hanging the painting?</p>
<p>Good luck, have fun!</p>

<![CDATA[<p>It was a dark and stormy knight. This was to his benefit, as his black armor helped him remain unspotted in the woods. Even the blazing midnoon sunlight could not cut through the dense canopy, leaving him well hidden in the dimly lit forest.</p>
<p>The knight lay prone amidst the dead leaves and branches, his satchel clutched close to his chest and his ear pressed to the ground. He waited till he was certain that the danger had passed, and then he waited some more. He finally got up and took a good look around.</p>
<p>The knight searched for clues that would help him find his destination, mayhaps a familiar tree or a rock formation, but found none. Although the woods were familiar to him &mdash; he had crossed them way more times than he cared for &mdash; he did not where he was. He had lost his bearings after the long and arduous chase. While he had managed to lose his followers, but he lost himself too.</p>
<p>The knight guessed he still had a long way to go, so he took a step in the direction that he thought would get him home.</p>

        <p>Full Name: The Tale of Desperaux being a story of a mouse, a princess, some soup, and a spool of thread.<br>
Author: Kate DiCamillo<br>
Illustrated by: Timothy Basil Ering</p>

<p>The Tale of Despereaux is an excellent book. The characters are adorable and very well developed. However, the ending seems to be very abrupt.</p>
<p>This story is set in a world where mice and rats can speak. It is wonderful to listen to what these animals have to say. Their behavior is portrayed very similar to human behavior. And just like humans, there are heroes and villains among mice and rats, who will go against the wind, do something incredible; because they want to do it, and are not influenced by what others say.</p>
<p>The writer frequently talks to the reader, often at the end of each chapter, making it more enticing to read ahead.</p>
<p>The book consists of four parts, the author calls it 4 books. In the first three books, the author introduces three main characters. Their history is well narrated, in quite detail. The story jumps forward and backward in time very often. This is not difficult to follow and adds to the narrative. The time jumps make it more interesting.  In the fourth book the three characters meet and have nice interactions. I felt that the ending was very short, not very detailed. It is sad because the reader wants to read more about these lovable characters. But then again, I understand that writing an ending is always the toughest part.</p>
<p>The book does have a lot of humorous moments, exaggeration that is totally unlikely and also slightly dark humor.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a very nice experience. I would rate it 7/10</p>
