<![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>This week, I watched Volume 1 of Stranger Things 4, and it was some of the best content I have ever seen. I can&rsquo;t wait for the last two episodes of this season to land on July 1.</p>
<p>If you would like to read the previous issues, you can do so at <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="recent-updates">Recent updates</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new with me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I shared a simple but tasty recipe of a <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/recipes/tomato-cheese-sandwich/">tomato cheese sandwich</a>.</li>
<li>It has started raining in Mumbai! The first showers of rain fell on Thursday. It reminds me of a photopoem I wrote last year titled <em>torrent</em>. Here&rsquo;s the photo

and <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/poems/torrent/">here&rsquo;s the poem →</a></li>
<li>I had gone to see the Gateway of India two weeks ago, and it looked pretty in purple.

It looked like a gateway (get it? &#x1f60f;) to the Upside Down.</li>

<h3 id="reading">Reading</h3>
<p>I read a New Yorker article titled <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/13/the-strange-and-secret-ways-that-animals-perceive-the-world-ed-yong-immense-world-tom-mustill-how-to-speak-whale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Strange and Secret Ways That Animals Perceive the World</a> by Elizabeth Kolbert. In this article, Kolbert talks about how there&rsquo;s so much that we don&rsquo;t know about animals: we don&rsquo;t know how they sense things, how they communicate with each other and with us. For instance, a researcher named Roger Payne found out about whale songs. He discovered that whales tend to repeat a sequence of sounds&ndash;that were 7 to 30 minutes long&ndash;over and over again. He thought of these as songs sung by the whales. He recorded this and released it as an album called &ldquo;Songs of the Humpback Whale&rdquo;. NASA even included these on Voyagers 1 and 2, which are now floating in space. Any alien that encounters these space probes will get a glimpse of what whales sound like. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjkxUA041nM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listen to these whale songs on YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>Related to this is another New Yorker article that I had read a while back: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/05/why-animals-dont-get-lost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Why Animals Don&rsquo;t Get Lost</a> by Kathryn Schulz. How do mammals, birds, and even insects such as butterflies navigate long distances and still reach at their intended destinations without the aid of a GPS? We are starting to understand this better with recent advancements in data collection, but there is still a long way to go. Both of these articles are humbling to read.</p>
<p>Speaking of whales, here&rsquo;s a news segment where Julianna McKannis asks a panel of experts: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POi4rvN_Yts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Should we be teaching our children more about whales?</a></p>

He uses maths, camera tracking and on-the-fly physics calculations to make sure that no matter how you throw the basketball, it goes in the hoop.
