<![CDATA[<p>The noon (12:00) rarely corresponds to the time when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.</p>
<p>Local noon will vary from place to place, and also depends on the day of the year.</p>
<p>The earth makes an angle of 23.5 degrees with the plane. It</p>
<p>The poles do not see the sun for long periods of time.</p>
<p>For places that between 23.5 degrees north and 23.5 degrees south, (also known as Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricon respectively) there are days when there is zero shadow.</p>
<p>If you live outside these latitudes, then this will never happen.</p>
<p>I am staying in Mumbai, which is at 19.1 degrees north latitude. Every year, 15 May and 26 Aug are zero shadow days.</p>
<p>Everything looks surreal, kind of like a video game where the shadows do not render.</p>
<p>This site by alok is a great place to visualise when zero shadow days occur at what places.
They have made an Android app as well.</p>
