<![CDATA[<p>I <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/uses/">use</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fedora Linux</a> with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Shell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GNOME desktop environment</a> on all of my computers.
<a href="https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-linux-42/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new version of Fedora (42, yay!)</a> was released recently, and with it came <a href="https://release.gnome.org/48/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new version of GNOME (48)</a>.
Each GNOME release is named after a city, and GNOME 48 is named &ldquo;Bengaluru&rdquo;, a city that I lived in for four years and absolutely love.</p>
<p>GNOME 48 is not a major update, but it comes with several quality-of-life improvements.
While many of the features new to GNOME 48 already exist in some form in other desktop environments and/or operating systems, it is great to see them included in GNOME.</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple notifications from the same application now stack. This reduces clutter and makes the notification panel better organised.</li>
<li>You can now limit charging your device to 80%. This reduces the strain on your battery and will improve the battery health in the long run, especially if you keep your laptop plugged in all day.</li>
<li>The default interface font was changed from Cantarell to Adwaita Sans, a modified version of <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inter</a>. I love how Inter looks. In fact, I use Inter widely across my site.</li>
<li>My favourite new feature in GNOME 48 is <em>Wellbeing</em>, which gives you screen time information and regular eyesight and movement break reminders.</li>
</ul>

<p>With Screen Time, I can now track how long I use my devices each day.
It also gives me the option to limit the usage in a day, after which the screen turns greyscale.
I have set the daily limit to be 8 hours, which while generous, helps me limit the time spent in front of the screen.
The Screen Time feature in macOS is more advanced:
it has features such as focus modes, time tracking on a per-app basis, and syncing usage data across devices.
While I would love to see some of these features included in GNOME, I am still happy with the simple implementation that we currently have.</p>
<p>I find the break reminders in GNOME very useful.
When I am working, it is very easy for me to become engrossed in my work and spend hours at a stretch staring at the screen without moving.
Break reminders remind me every once in a while to take a break.
The screen dims and a notification appears, telling me what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Eyesight reminders tell me to look away from the screen, into the distance, for about 20 seconds.
This gives my eyes some much needed rest.</li>
<li>Movement reminders tell me to get up and move around for a while. I take movement breaks for five minutes every thirty minutes.
During the break, I get up, move around the room, stretch my body, and do some light workout.
I also finish up small tasks such as organising my desk and my room, and refilling my water bottle.
In some breaks, I simply stare out of the window and think about how I want to spend the next 25 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>When these breaks end, there is an audible ding, indicating that it is time to resume work.
I have found that taking these short breaks immensely improve my wellbeing, just as the name of the feature suggests.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Today, I updated my system running Arch Linux after a month using <code>pacman -Syu</code>. I rebooted my system to find a black screen instead of the SDDM login screen. I tried pressing the Caps Lock key, and I could see its light toggle. This meant that things were not that bad.</p>
<p>I changed the tty using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> and logged in to my system. I tried downgrading the Linux kernel but that didn&rsquo;t help. I tried disabling the optimus-manager and sddm services, and tried starting the Xorg server using <code>startx</code> or <code>xinit</code>. None of this worked.</p>
<p>The fix was to rebuild the optimus-manager package. It turns out that Python was upgraded from 3.9 to 3.10 in the update, and this broke Optimus Manager. I rebuilt it, and I am able to access the login screen and my window manager again.</p>
<p>I could see that some of my AUR packages were still built using older versions of Python using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">pacman -Qoq /usr/lib/python3.9
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I rebuilt all those packages to use the latest Python version.
I also finally installed <code>yay</code> to manage all my AUR packages.</p>
