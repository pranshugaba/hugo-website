<p>The following recipe makes one sandwich. It takes less than 5 minutes to make one.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 slices of sliced multigrain bread</li>
<li>1 tomato</li>
<li>1 cheese slice</li>
<li>1 tsp of red chilli powder</li>
<li>1 tsp of black pepper powder</li>
<li>1 tsp of chaat masala</li>
<li>A pinch of rock salt</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut moderately thin slices of tomato and arrange them on a slice of bread. (Since this sandwich has only tomatoes and no other filling, I am generous with the tomatoes. I add 6-10 slices depending on the size of the tomato.)</li>
<li>Sprinkle rock salt, red chilli powder, black pepper powder, and chaat masala on the tomatoes.

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>The cheese slice absorbs some spiciness, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to add the spices.</li>
<li>You may use brown bread (whole wheat bread) if multigrain bread is not available.</li>
<li>You can experiment with different types of breads, cheeses, and spices.</li>

<![CDATA[<img src="https://pranshugaba.com/recipes/starfruit-sandwich/starfuit_sandwich_featured_hu5b6d7e0f835b89136611f47ab3106d78_317090_1080x0_resize_q75_h2_box_2.webp" alt="" /><p>One day, many moons ago, I went out in Bangalore for a long walk and bought an assortment of groceries from different parts of the city: Organic spinach bread, starfruits, tomatoes, cheese cubes, rock salt, and a knife.</p>
<p>When I returned to my room, I tried to make a sandwich from what I had bought. The result: A delicious juicy sandwich with a variety of tastes and textures that is also easy to make.</p>
<p>The following recipe makes one sandwich. Two or three such sandwiches would make a meal.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 slices of sliced bread (preferably spinach bread)</li>
<li>1 starfruit</li>
<li>1 tomato</li>
<li>1 cheese cube of 20g</li>
<li>Rock salt</li>
<li>Pringles (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cut a tomato into two halves. Cut one half into four slices. Keep the other half aside.</li>
<li>Arrange the tomato slices on a slice of bread.</li>
<li>Sprinkle some rock salt on the tomato slices.</li>
<li>Cut a starfruit into thin slices.</li>
<li>Place five starfruit slices in the shape of a star on the tomatoes. Keep the remaining slices aside.

<li>Sprinkle some rock salt on the starfuit slices.</li>
<li>Cut a quarter of the cheese cube and keep it aside. Slice the remaining cube and place the slices over the starfruit.</li>
<li>Cover with a slice of bread, and cut diagonally into two triangles.

</li>
<li>Enjoy your starfruit sandwich! Intersperse with bites of tomato, starfruit, and cheese that you had kept aside.
Optionally, consume some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hyperbolic paraboloid potato-based crisps</a> on the side.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<ul>
<li>Starfruit seeds are soft and are easily cut with a knife. Inspect the starfruit slices closely and make sure that you remove all seed fragments from the slices. A starfruit typically has 4-6 seeds in it.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have spinach bread, you may use whole wheat bread or multigrain bread instead. You can apply some mint chutney to the bread slices to make it tastier.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t have starfruit available, you may use a cucumber instead. However, this is not as much fun.</li>
