<![CDATA[<p>The year 2022 is over, and a new year has begun.
In this issue of my newsletter, I share some highlights of the past year, as well as some goals that I have set for the coming year.</p>
<p>As always, if you would like to read previous issues, you can do so at <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter/">https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter</a></p>
<h2 id="my-highlights-of-2022">My highlights of 2022</h2>
<h3 id="travel-in-2022">Travel in 2022</h3>
<p>I travelled to a fair share of new places in 2022.</p>
<h4 id="kolkata">Kolkata</h4>
<p>I went to a friends&rsquo; wedding in Kolkata in April. It was my first visit to the city, and I loved the sights and the foods there.
I walked across the Hooghly river along the Howrah bridge, bought novels from College street, and ate some roadside phuchka.

</p>
<h4 id="israel">Israel</h4>
<p>I attended the <a href="https://www.floc2022.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FLoC conference</a> in Haifa, Israel in August.
This was my first time in a new country on my own and it was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>Haifa is one of the most beautiful cities I have ever been to.
The city sits on a hill, which means that walking in the city is akin to trekking.
Haifa also abuts the beautiful Mediterranean sea and it was a delight to swim in those cool blue waters.
While I missed some of the Indian spices in the food there, I loved the bread, the hummus, and the falafels.

</p>
<h4 id="chennai">Chennai</h4>
<p>I attended the <a href="https://www.fsttcs.org.in/2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FSTTCS conference</a> in IIT Madras in December.
The campus of IIT Madras (along with Guindy national park) is a literally a forest in the middle of the city and is teeming with deer and monkeys.
I had never seen so many deer up close before.</p>
<p>Chennai is great city to go for a walk in.
I went for a <a href="https://madrasinherited.in/walk/kutchery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heritage walk</a> on Kutchery road in Mylapore where I learnt about the rich history of the various shops and establishments in that locality.

</p>
<h3 id="books-in-2022">Books in 2022</h3>
<p>After a slump of 4 years, I picked up reading this year again.
Here are some of the books that I read this year and particularly enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The Stranger</em> by Albert Camus<br>
A short novella in two parts. A very interesting read. I cannot say anything more about this book without spoiling it.</li>
<li><em>A Terrible Book</em> by Jay Micheal<br>
This bellyachingly hilarious book is a parody of almost every literary trope that exists. It is available as an eBook for $0.99 on Kindle, and nowhere else. The author remains elusive, but it is not for a lack of trying. I am not able to find any information about the author other than his short bio and brilliantly drawn self-portrait on this book&rsquo;s listing on Amazon.</li>
<li><em>Crime and Punishment</em> by Fyodor Dostoevsky<br>
This book shares themes with <em>The Stranger</em>.
This book is about what drives a man to kill a person, and the mental anguish that he suffers as a consequence.
The plot slows down and is drawn out at times, but I think that it is necessary to better understand the plight of the antihero.</li>
<li><em>The Book Thief</em> by Markus Zusak<br>
Set during the Second World War, this story follows the life of a little girl living in Nazi Germany who loves to read books. A tale narrated by Death himself, you can&rsquo;t not read this.</li>
<li><em>Project Hail Mary</em> by Andy Weir<br>
While this book is science fiction, but it doesn&rsquo;t read as such.
Everything that happens in the story seems scientifically plausible; you might as well be reading the logs of a real astronaut.
It is great to see the thought process of the protagonist as he tackles the problems he encounters.
Once I started reading it, it was downright impossible to put it down.
I finished reading it in less than three days.</li>
<li><em>Elantris</em> by Brandon Sanderson<br>
This is a fantasy novel and one of the first books published by Brandon Sanderson.
The story is told through the points-of-view of three characters: a prince, a princess, and a priest, each having different motives and personalities.
It is particularly fun when these characters interact and you experience the same scene from different viewpoints.
I also loved the magic system in this story.
This is a standalone book and a complete story on its own. All in all, it&rsquo;s a very satisfying and thrilling book.</li>
<li><em>The Sword of Kaigen</em> by M. L. Wang<br>
This is a fantasy book with a Japanesque setting.
I could feel some vibes of  <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> while reading this book, primarily because some characters can manipulate the elements around them.
If you liked that show, then you will probably enjoy reading this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more books that I have read and would like to read.
You can have a look at my <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/reads/">reading list</a> that I regularly keep up-to-date.</p>
<h3 id="tv-shows-and-movies-in-2022">TV Shows and Movies in 2022</h3>
<p>It was a great year for movies and TV Shows.
Here are some of my favourites of the year.</p>
<h4 id="tv-shows">TV Shows</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Barry (season 3)</em><br>
The penultimate season of the series.
This show is an unusual combination of drama and comedy, where the eponymous character Barry is both an actor and an assassin.
Now, his worlds are about to collide.
Barry is played by Bill Hader who is amazing in this role.
He also writes and directs some of the episodes.</li>
<li><em>The Rehearsal (season 1)</em><br>
A masterpiece by Nathan Fielder. Very meta. It is safe to say that this show is like none other. I was surprised to find out that there will be another season of this show.</li>
<li><em>Better Call Saul (season 6)</em><br>
A satisfying end to the chicanery of Saul Goodman and to the Breaking Bad universe. It&rsquo;s all gone now. Bravo Vince!</li>
<li><em>House of the Dragon (season 1)</em><br>
I will be honest, my expectations for this show were super low after seeing how <em>Game of Thrones</em> ended.
However, I was convinced otherwise before the first episode ended.
This show has a lot of plotting, stabbing, and backstabbing, and keeps you at the edge of your seat.
George R. R. Martin is, of course, a masterful story teller, and the showrunners Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik have done an excellent job translating it to screen.
A special shout-out to Paddy Considine, who was phenomenal as King Viserys.
This was a rare occurence where I watched the show before reading the book.
I have got to read <em>Fire and Blood</em> now.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="movies">Movies</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</em><br>
An amazing action-comedy movie starring Nicholas Cage as Nick Cage, as well as Pedro Pascal. This is a fun movie to watch.</li>
<li><em>Chello Show</em><br>
A Gujarati movie about a boy fascinated by movies.</li>
<li><em>Bullet Train</em><br>
Another action-comedy movie. As the name suggests, this almost entirely takes place on a bullet train. This movie has great action sequences, and the dialogue and story are quite good too.</li>
<li><em>Glass Onion</em><br>
While I didn&rsquo;t like it as much as <em>Knives Out</em>, it was still entertaining to see Detective Benoit Blanc back on screen.</li>
<li><em>The Menu</em><br>
Anya Tayloy-Joy and Ralph Fiennes are great in this, and so are the supporting cast.
Not sure if this is a horror or a comedy.
It is definitely absurd.
A culinary delight.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="games-in-2022">Games in 2022</h3>
<p>Some games that I discovered and enjoyed playing this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Duotrigordle / Redactle / Worldle</em><br>
Wordle became popular at the start of this year, and we saw many new *le games.
These were the ones that I played the most.</li>
<li><em>NYTimes spelling bee and crossword</em><br>
I try to solve the NYT Spelling Bee daily and the crossword whenever I can. I can usually only solve the Mondays and Tuesdays crosswords.</li>
<li><em>Dark Souls</em><br>
I started playing Dark Souls. I was initially hesitant, or even scared to play it. However, the Souls-like games are so good and they have spoiled most other games for me. Praise the sun! \o/</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="my-goals-for-2023">My goals for 2023</h2>
<p>I have set some goals for myself for this year.</p>
<h3 id="reading-and-writing">Reading and writing</h3>
<p>I would like to write more often and on a regular basis.
I want to be uploading new content on this website more frequently.
I also want to read more books this year.</p>
<h3 id="getting-fit">Getting fit</h3>
<p>I will start going to the gym or cycling regularly.</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>I want to learn more languages and become a hyperpolyglot.
I plan to achieve</p>
<ul>
<li>native fluency in ગુજરાતી,</li>
<li>moderate fluency in français, and</li>
<li>basic conversational fluency in मराठी and Deutsch.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will use flashcards and Rosetta Stone to improve my vocabulary and grammar.
I will also try to read literature, watch movies, and connect with native speakers to practice and get better at these languages.</p>
<h3 id="game-development">Game development</h3>
<p>I want to get good at game development.
By the end of the year, I want to be comfortable enough with the game engine Godot that creating simple arcade style games such as Tetris, Pacman, and Flappy Bird are second-nature to me.
I would also like to make and publish one or two moderately complex games.
I would need to collaborate with someone for the aspects of gamedev that are not my fortes such as pixel art and sound design.</p>
<hr>
<p>I will also post some short term goals, and from time to time share updates on how I am progressing along these goals for 2023.
<a href="https://pranshugaba.com/contact/">Let me know</a> what have you planned for this new year!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all for now! See you in the next one. &#x1f44b;</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I am back after a bit of a break. To make up for it, here&rsquo;s a longer than usual issue of my newsletter where I share updates about me, this site, and other miscellaneous things.
Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new since the last issue:</p>
<h2 id="recent-updates">Recent updates</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Grant Sanderson of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3Blue1Brown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3Blue1Brown</a> is back this year with another Summer of Maths Exposition (SoME #2). The goal of this contest is to encourage people to create some awesome maths explainers. You can <a href="https://pranshugaba.com/articles/some-2/">read my article on SoME #2</a> for more details about the contest. There&rsquo;s only one month left to submit your explainers, so this is a good time to get started!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GMTK Game Jam 2022 is live! The GMTK game jam started in 2017 and has been taking place every year in July since then. The theme of this year&rsquo;s jam is &ldquo;Roll of the Dice&rdquo;. You must create and share a playable game based on the theme in less than 50 hours. It is not easy to create a game that works and is also fun to play in this short period of time, and yet each year, we see some amazing games come out of these game jams.<br>
<a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about the GMTK game jam 2022 →</a></p>
<p>Only 24 of the 50 hours of the jam are left at the time of writing this post, so it would be difficult for you to submit a game for this game jam if you didn&rsquo;t know about it before. You can, however, play the games submitted in the jam and vote for the ones you like. You can also start preparing for next year&rsquo;s GMTK game jam. GMTK&rsquo;s YouTube channel is great place to learn about concepts in game design. Pick a game engine such as Godot or Bevy and start making your own game!</p>
<p>The GMTK game jam is only one of the very many game jams that happen. You can find more <a href="https://itch.io/jams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jams on itch.io</a>. The schedule is jam-packed with game jams. There is always some jam in progress and some upcoming jams that you can look forward to participate in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking of games, I started playing <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>.
It&rsquo;s another masterpiece by From Software. In this game, you are a Shinobi warrior in Japan trying to fight Dragonrot.</p>
<p>It is a fun and exciting game that rewards persistence, determination, and exploration. The game seems terrifyingly difficult, and at times, even impossible. However, you must remember that the developers of this game are on your side. They want you to succeed. Keep trying! You will learn something with each death, you <em>will</em> get better at this game. When you finally defeat that difficult boss that you were stuck on for so long, it&rsquo;s the best feeling in the world.</p>

  <figure >

      <figcaption>
          
              I am down to my last of health and I have used up all health potions and pellets after defeating a difficult boss. I realise to my horror that the boss has a second phase.

  </figure>
  

<p>Sekiro differs from the Dark Souls games in many aspects. Unlike Dark Souls, this game has only one weapon, the sword. It does not punish you for teleporting to the last checkpoint. The game let&rsquo;s you die once and resurrect without having to start from the last checkpoint. There is no stamina meter, you can keep sprinting without tiring. There is even a jump button in this game!</p>
<p>And yet, it is a From Software game at heart. The combat is fun, you will die again and again and again, dying will hurt as you will lose your precious skill points and coints, and of course, there is no difficulty setting. I have played it for about 15 hours and am stuck on some difficult bosses, but I am confident I will be able to defeat them all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I watched <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em> last week. It was a delight to hear Steve Carell&rsquo;s voice as Young Gru. I also loved that we got to meet the younger versions of many characters from the Despicable Me movies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This is a great time to be watching TV shows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first episode of <em>Better Call Saul</em> after the mid-season break premiered last Monday. The episode was one hour long, but it was so packed with action that it only felt like five minutes. I was holding my breath and was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The story is approaching the start of Breaking Bad when we first see Saul in that show. There are only five episodes left and the show will be over in five weeks. I will be sad when this show ends :(</li>
<li>Volume 2 of <em>Stranger Things 4</em> came out on July 1. Unfortunately for me, some details of the ending were spoiled for me, but I enjoyed watching the show nonetheless.</li>
<li>Season 2 of <em>Only Murders in the Building</em> is going on. It is as intriguing as the first season. Steve Martin and Martin Short are an amazing duo.</li>
<li>The first two episodes of season 4 of <em>What We Do in the Shadows</em> premiered this Tuesday. Nadja, Nandor, Lazlo, and Gizmo are all reunited once again!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I wrote a photopoem titled <em>rain train</em>. Here&rsquo;s the photo

<h3 id="youtube-videos">YouTube videos</h3>
<p>Here are some YouTube videos that I watched and enjoyed recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q_05PUYv1o&amp;list=PLNYkxOF6rcIAKIQFsNbV0JDws_G_bnNo9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTTP 203</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qen5CKjUe8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cassie Evans talks to Jake about about SVG paths</a> and what the various letters and symbols in an SVG file mean. The SVG format is similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turtle graphics</a> most commonly seen in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Logo programming language</a>. I am loving the new episodes of HTTP 203, but this does not mean I don&rsquo;t miss Surma.</li>
<li>I used to <em>love</em> playing the Harry Potter games on PC. Which is why I was delighted when I found this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-A2XlJsC84" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Christo Vuchetich, a game designer who worked on the Harry Potter PC games</a>. It is incredible how the game was made in a year with very little access to how the Harry Potter movies would look like. An interview on the Chamber of Secrets game is coming soon.  I cannot wait to watch it.</li>
<li>The team at Polygon play a game of Clay-O-Rama which is like DnD, but the players make clay figurines of their characters. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbEBGf1J_qw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simone, Pat, and Christina play the game with Jenna as their DM</a>.</li>

<li>Fractals are beautiful! But what are they? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofFLYfUEPVE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keenan Crane, a computer scientist from CMU, explains what are fractals in 5 different levels of difficulty</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="online-games">Online games</h3>
<p>You may enjoy playing these games:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Regular tic-tac-toe becomes boring after a while. If both players play optimally, then the game will end in a tie. I would like to introduce you to a bidding version of the same game. In regular tic-tac-toe, both players take turns alternatingly to place their respective symbol on the grid. In the bidding version, both players start with a limited fund of say 100 points. At the start of each turn, they both bid some points. The player with the higher bid gets to place their symbol on the grid but must pay their bid amount to the other player.</p>
<p>The players must not only decide where to place their symbol in their turn in case they win the bid, but they must also decide how much to bid. Should they go all in in the start and occupy a good starting square? Or should they save their points for the endgame to play several turns at one and deliver a deathblow? You can try it yourself and play with a friend on this website: <a href="http://biddingttt.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bidding TTT</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might have played the game Wordle where you try to guess a word in 5 tries. You may like <a href="https://www.quordle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quordle</a> more. In this game, you are required to guess four words within nine guesses. In case this was not enough, you can try <a href="https://duotrigordle.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Duotrigordle</a>. In this game, you must guess 32 words and you have 37 guesses to do so.  It was surprised to find that Duotrigordle was easier than Quordle.  Let me know which variant of Wordle is your favourite.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="two-songs">Two songs</h3>
<p>Here are two songs from Eurovision that you may enjoy:</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Do you love playing video games? I sure do! I enjoy making games too, and it&rsquo;s highly likely that you would too.
Game development is an umbrella term for ranging from designing levels, mechanics to coding the logic to making art and music.
It has a little something for everyone. If you would like to learn how to make games, then this guide is a great place to start, if I do say so myself.</p>
<p>In this guide, we will make an X and O game using Godot.
This is a great first game to make as it is not too complex, and yet it
covers many important aspects of game development.</p>
<p>We will look at some of the most important programming paradigms in game development.
We will learn how to make games using Godot.</p>
<p>There are no prerequisites, except for critical thinking, reasoning, and basic computer skills. Prior programming experience is helpful, but not necessary.
The goal of the guide is to get you comfortable with using Godot to build simple games.</p>
<p>By the end of this guide, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design a gameplay loop for the game</li>
<li>Create a complete working game
<ul>
<li>Display images and text in the game</li>
<li>Keep track of the state of the game</li>
<li>Listen for clicks in an area</li>
<li>Detect and respond to keyboard presses</li>
<li>Create, emit, and connect signals</li>
<li>Decide and check win conditions of a game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Export your game and share it with others</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-godot">About Godot</h3>
<p>We will use Godot &ndash; an amazing game engine &ndash; to make our game.
A game engine is software that handles and integrates various aspects of game development: graphics, physics, logic, sound, interface, input, and more.
Some other popular game engines are Unity and Unreal.
I will describe some advantages that Godot has over them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Godot is free and open-source.
You can visit <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot&rsquo;s GitHub page</a> and look at Godot&rsquo;s source code. You can study how it&rsquo;s made and how it works.
You can report bugs and contribute to the codebase yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any game that you make using Godot belongs to you, and any profit you make is yours to keep. This is not the case with most other game engines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Godot works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. In particular, Godot has first-class support for
Linux. Since I primarily use Linux, this is perfect for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Godot is lightweight. Godot is only a 35 MB download, it starts up in seconds, and is very light on CPU and memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Godot is a joy to use. The UI is simple and shows you only what you need to see, allowing you to focus on your work. It is also customisable: you can change the colour scheme and the fonts of the editor as you please.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download Godot for free from <a href="https://godotengine.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot&rsquo;s website</a>. We will write code in GDScript and not C#, so we do not need the Mono version. Select
your operating system, download the Standard version, and extract
and run!</p>

        Aside
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>btw, I use arch.  If you use Arch Linux, installing Godot is even easier.  Just <code>pacman -S godot</code>!</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>This guide uses Godot 3.3.2, the latest stable version available at the time
of writing. Godot tries to maintain backward compatibility, so this guide should work for future versions of Godot 3 as well.</p>
<p>The complete code of the finished version of the game is available on my GitHub page.
If you face any issue, if something&rsquo;s not working, you can compare your code with it.
You can also play the final version game to see how it works on my itch.io page.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get started!</p>
<h2 id="setting-things-up">Setting things up</h2>
<h3 id="planning-the-game">Planning the game</h3>
<p>Before we start any work on a game in Godot, it is important to plan out how the game would look and behave. Having a concrete picture of the game in mind will help us when we develop the game in Godot.</p>
<p>Here are some helpful questions that we can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the genre/theme of the game?</li>
<li>What is the name of the game?</li>
<li>How many players can play the game? (single-player or multiplayer)</li>
<li>What are the objectives of the game?</li>
<li>What device will it be played on?</li>
<li>How does the user interact with the game?</li>
<li>How does the user interface look like?</li>
<li>What happens in a typical gameplay?</li>
<li>How long does a gameplay session last?</li>
</ul>
<p>This list isn&rsquo;t exhaustive, but it gets you thinking about most major details of the game. The answers to these questions will directly impact the decisions you take when you develop the game. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The theme of the game will affect the choice of your art, sound, and music.</li>
<li>A multiplayer game will have different input systems and networking requirements compared to a single-player game.</li>
<li>Games developed for mobile will have a different interface compared to games developed for desktop.</li>
</ul>



<aside class="admonition note">
    <div class="admonition__title">
        Note
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>Of course, the answers to these questions are not fixed; they will most likely change as you work on the game. As you build the game and test it, you might find that a feature you had planned doesn&rsquo;t do well in practice.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might come up with a better alternative during development.</li>
<li>Your idea might be too complex to explain to the player.</li>
<li>It might not be as exciting as you thought it would be.</li>
<li>It might be hard to implement because of some technical limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be open to making changes to your game as you work on it.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>Let&rsquo;s answer these questions for our X and O game.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a puzzle game. It is bright and colourful.</li>
<li>We will call it &ldquo;X and O&rdquo;.</li>
<li>It is played by two players.</li>
<li>The objective of the player is to place three of the same symbol in a row, column, or diagonal.</li>
<li>It can be played on desktop.</li>
<li>The player clicks on the squares to enter symbols.</li>
<li>I have made a rough sketch how the interface would look like. This will be a simple game with just one scene. In more complex games, we would need more scenes.

  <figure class="diagram">
      
      
      
      
      
      <picture>
          
          <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/sketch.png" alt="We have the game title, some instructions, the grid, and some labels to show whose turn it is to play.">

              We have the game title, some instructions, the grid, and some labels to show whose turn it is to play.
              
              
              
          
      </figcaption>
      
  </figure>
  
</li>
<li>We will describe the gameplay loop using a flowchart. It will also tell us how long a session will last.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-gameplay-loop">The gameplay loop</h3>
<p>We want to write down how the state of the game changes as the player plays the game.
We want to explicitly state how the game receives inputs, what decisions it takes, what changes it makes, and how all of these relate to each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;X and O&rdquo; is a small and simple game, so its gameplay loop is simple too.</p>

<figure class="diagram">
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/gameloop.png" alt="The gameplay loop">

    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>To summarise:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the game starts, we listen for clicks on the grid.</li>
<li>When the player clicks on a cell, we show the appropriate symbol in that cell.</li>
<li>We then compute if someone has won. If not, then we check if the game has drawn.</li>
<li>If the game has ended (by a win or a draw), then we display the name of the winner and give an option to start a new game. Otherwise, we go back to listening for clicks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each round of the game lasts no more than a minute. Players may play multiple rounds in a session.</p>
<p>Now that we have a good picture of how the game would work, we are ready to start working in Godot.</p>
<h3 id="project-setup">Project setup</h3>
<p>Open Godot and create a new project. We will call it <code>x-and-o</code>. Choose an empty folder to save the project in, preferably with the same name as the game.
Select &ldquo;Create &amp; Edit&rdquo; to create the project.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/create-project.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>By default, when we start a new project, Godot starts in 3D mode. We are making a 2D game, so switch to 2D mode by clicking on &ldquo;2D&rdquo; at the top. The default shortcut to enter 2D mode is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F1</kbd>.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/2d-mode.png" alt="Click on 2D.">

            Click on 2D.
            
            
            
        
    </figcaption>
    
</figure>


<p>Screens come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Some are square, some are tall, some are wide.
We want our game to render correctly on all screens.
Since this is our first game, we will keep it simple.
We will target a fixed resolution, so we do not have to worry about making the layout responsive.</p>
<p>To achieve this, open Project -&gt; Project Settings.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/project-settings-menu.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>In the General tab, look for the section named &ldquo;Window&rdquo; in &ldquo;Display&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Set <code>Width</code> to <code>1280</code> and <code>Height</code> to <code>720</code>. This sets the aspect ratio of the game to 16:9, the most common aspect ratio for screens.</li>
<li>In the same section, scroll down to &ldquo;Stretch&rdquo;, and set <code>Mode</code> to <code>2d</code> and <code>Aspect</code> to <code>keep</code>. Now, if the aspect ratio of the screen is not 16:9, then Godot will not distort the content. It will pad the content with black bars instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>This way our game looks reasonably good on all screens with minimal effort. We will learn how to make a responsive layout another time.</p>
<p>By default, the background colour of the game is dark grey. Let&rsquo;s change the background colour. In the same &ldquo;General&rdquo; tab of project settings, go to Rendering -&gt; Environment -&gt; Default Clear Colour.
As mentioned before, I want the game to be bright and colourful.
I set it to <code>#ffffff</code>, which is the hex code for white. Feel free to choose a colour that goes with your theme.</p>
<h3 id="importing-assets">Importing assets</h3>
<p>Looking at the sketch interface, we see that we need to display some X&rsquo;s, some O&rsquo;s, and the grid on the screen.
We would load the images for these in Godot.
We show some text in our game, and we will need to load a nice font for it.</p>
<p>I have made an assets folder that you can use to make the game. It contains <code>x.png</code>, <code>o.png</code>, <code>grid.png</code>, and <code>Inter-Regular.ttf</code>.
You can <NavExtLink to="/">download my assets</NavExtLink>, or you can make your own.</p>

	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>I made the png files for X, O, and the grid using <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inkscape</a>. It is an excellent application for making vector art. It is free software, and I highly recommend it.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>I have included the <code>Inter</code> font in the assets. I chose this font because it looks sharp even at low resolutions and it goes well with the &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo; sprites that I have made. You can use any font that goes with your theme.</p>

Make sure you have the rights to use the font you choose.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>We need to add these assets to our project in Godot.
Make an <code>assets</code> folder in your game&rsquo;s root folder <code>x-and-o</code> using your file manager. (Use File Explorer if you are using Windows, Finder if you are on macOS). Move the sprites and the font in it.
When you open Godot, you will see those files in the FileSystem tab.</p>

</figure>


<h2 id="building-the-interface">Building the interface</h2>
<p>We have imported all the resources that we need in Godot. We can now start building the user interface.</p>
<p>Whether we want to display an image, play a sound, or display some text in Godot, we do so by adding a node for it. A Godot game is made by composing together different kinds of nodes.</p>



<aside class="admonition note">
    <div class="admonition__title">
        Note
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>Read the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scenes_and_nodes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot docs on Scenes and Nodes</a> to understand how they work.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>We will add a root node that will hold all nodes in our game.
Click on <code>Create root node</code> -&gt; <code>2D node</code> in the Scene tab. This will create a root node named <code>Node2D</code>. Rename it to <code>Game</code>.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Now that we have a root node, we can save the scene and run the game. Save the scene by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd>.
Make a <code>scenes</code> folder in the root directory and save this scene in it as <code>Game.tscn</code>.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/save-game-scene.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>





<aside class="admonition note">
    <div class="admonition__title">
        Note
    </div>
	<div class="admonition__content">
        <p>Scenes are saved with the <code>.tscn</code> file extension.</p>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>Run the game by clicking the play button (or press <kbd>F5</kbd>). The first time you run the game, Godot will ask you to set the main scene. The main scene is the scene that loads when you run the game. Select the <code>Game.tscn</code> scene we just saved.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Of course, we haven&rsquo;t added anything to our scene yet, so we only see a blank screen when the game is run.
Close the window (or press <kbd>F8</kbd>) to stop the preview.</p>
<p>We look to our sketch to help us build the interface. We need a grid, some X&rsquo;s, some O&rsquo;s, and some text labels.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the labels because they are simpler.</p>
<h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
<p>We can display text in a game with a <code>Label</code> node. Select <code>Game</code> and click on the plus icon to add a child node. In the &ldquo;Create New Node&rdquo; dialog that appears, search for <code>Label</code>, and click on &ldquo;Create&rdquo;.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/label-node.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>A <code>Label</code> node appears as a child of <code>Game</code> in the scene tab.
Rename the name of this node to <code>GameName</code> because that&rsquo;s what it is.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/scene-tree-gamename.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>We do not see any change in our game because the label has no text. We can add/edit the text of the <code>Label</code> by editing the <code>Text</code> property in the inspector tab. This label will display the name of the game: &ldquo;X and O&rdquo;. Change the text of the label to &ldquo;X and O&rdquo;.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/inspector-label-text.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>The label is hard to read: it is small and is white on a white background. We will fix this by using a custom font.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/label-bad.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>In the inspector tab, in <code>Custom Fonts</code>, enable the Font property. Click on Empty -&gt; New DynamicFont.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/new-dynamic-font.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Click on &ldquo;Dynamic Font&rdquo; to show some additional settings. In Font -&gt; Font Data, click on Empty -&gt; Load and select your font file. We can adjust the font size in <code>Settings</code>. We would like the name of the game to be big, so I set the font size to <code>96</code>. We can also change the font colours in Custom Colours -&gt; Font colours. Play with the parameters until you have happy with the appearance.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/dynamic-font.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>We have three more labels to show in our interface. Repeat this process three times to end up with a total of four labels.
I made three new <code>Label</code> nodes with names <code>WinCondition</code>, <code>PlayerTurn</code>, and <code>PlayerInstruction</code>. My game looks like this now.</p>

<p>Our text looks good. Next, we will add the grid.</p>
<h3 id="the-grid">The Grid</h3>
<p>The grid is a bit more complex. In addition to showing the grid, we also need to listen for clicks and display an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or &ldquo;O&rdquo; in each of the nine cells.</p>
<p>Create a 2D node and name it <code>Grid</code>. We will store all nodes related to the grid as children of this node. This will make our <code>Game</code> scene more organised.</p>
<p>We can show images in Godot using the <code>Sprite</code> node.
Add a child node to <code>Grid</code> of type <code>Sprite</code>, and rename the node to <code>GridSprite</code>.
We do not see any change in our game because the sprite does not have a texture. Drag and drop <code>grid.png</code> from the FileSystem to the <code>Texture</code> property of the sprite.</p>
<p>We can see the grid in our game now, but it&rsquo;s too big for our screen. We need to scale it down.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>In <code>GridSprite</code>, in transform, set the Scale to <code>0.3</code> and <code>0.3</code>.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>The grid fits in the screen now.</p>

</figure>


<p>We want to be able to detect clicks.
We can detect clicks in an area using the <code>Area2D</code> node. We will have nine <code>Area2D</code> nodes, one for each cell of the grid.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s add one <code>Area2D</code> node as a child of <code>Grid</code>, and rename it to <code>GridCell</code>. This gives
a yellow warning symbol. Hover over it, and it tells us to add a <code>CollisionShape2D</code> as a child.
We get this warning because we have an <code>Area2D</code> node, but we haven&rsquo;t defined its area. Add a <code>CollisionShape2D</code> as a child of <code>GridCell</code> to remove this warning.</p>
<p>The <code>CollisionShape2D</code> now shows a warning: it needs a shape to function. Our cells are squares, so we select New RectangleShape2D in the inspector tab.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Resize and move the blue area so it covers one of the grid cells.
Using Grid Snap will make it easier to fit the CollisionShape2D on the cell perfectly.</p>

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>We would like to show &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo; symbols in the cells when the game is played. Recall that we show images using the <code>Sprite</code> node.
Add a <code>Sprite</code> as a child of <code>GridCell</code>, and rename it to <code>CellSymbol</code>. Choose the texture as <code>x.png</code>. If you are using my assets, you will need to scale it to <code>0.3</code> and translate it by <code>96</code> and <code>96</code> to centre the image in the cell.</p>
<p>Our <code>GridCell</code> node is ready. We could duplicate it nine times and our game would work.
However, if we want to make any changes to this node in the future, we would have to apply the changes on all nine nodes. This is tedious at best, and a source for errors at worst.</p>
<p>We solve this problem by saving the <code>GridCell</code> node as a scene. Then, anytime we want to use this node, we can create an instance of it. Any changes that we make to the <code>GridCell</code> scene will be reflected in all of its instances.</p>
<p>To save the node as a scene, right-click on the node in the Scene tab, select &ldquo;Save Branch as Scene&rdquo;, and save it as <code>GridCell.tscn</code> in the <code>scenes</code> folder.</p>
<p>The <code>GridCell</code> node has changed to an instance of the scene. You can see the new button now. Click on the &ldquo;Open in Editor&rdquo; button to edit it.</p>

<figure >

    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Duplicate the node nine times. Move the nodes so we have one in each grid. Make sure to arrange them in order, because we will refer to them later when we want to detect win conditions. Also, rename <code>GridCell</code> to <code>GridCell1</code> for consistency.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/nine-gridcells.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>The texture that we set in the sprite in <code>GridCell</code> appears nine times in the grid. If we change the texture of the sprite in the <code>GridCell</code> scene, say to <code>x.png</code>, then observe that the sprite of every cell in the grid changes to an &ldquo;X&rdquo;.</p>

<figure >
    
    
    
    
    
    <picture>
        
        <img src="https://pranshugaba.com/dev/building-x-and-o-using-godot/img/grid-complete.png" >
    </picture>
    
    
</figure>


<p>Since we start the game with the empty grid, we don&rsquo;t want any of the X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s to show initially. We will show them one by one, programmatically, when the players play the game. For now, remove the texture from the <code>CellSymbol</code> sprite in <code>GridCell</code> to get an empty grid.</p>
<p>We have added all the nodes needed to make the game, but the game is still static and doesn&rsquo;t do much.
We will now add the code to make it dynamic and interactive.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-the-logic">Implementing the logic</h2>
<p>We control the behaviour of nodes using scripting. Godot officially supports 4 languages for scripts: GDScript, VisualScript, C#, and C++. You can read more about them in <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scripting docs</a></p>
<p>We will write our scripts in GDScript. Its syntax is similar to Python.
You can read the <a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Godot Docs for GDScript</a> for more information about GDScript.</p>
<p>Click on the Attach Script button to attach a script to the <code>Game</code> node.</p>

<figure >

<p>This shows the &ldquo;Attach Script dialog&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The default options are fine, click &ldquo;Create&rdquo;. This will create a file named <code>Game.gd</code>. This is where will write the logic for the game.

<p>The <code>_ready</code> method is called when the <code>Game</code> node and all its children have entered the scene tree and have become active. Therefore, any work that we want to do when the game starts, we do it in <code>_ready</code>.
This mostly involves initialising variables.</p>
<p>The <code>_process</code> method is called every frame. Anything that must be done every frame goes in <code>_process</code>. For example, in a platformer game, we would need to update the position of the character every frame, so we would calculate its position in <code>_process</code>. We won&rsquo;t use <code>_process</code> much in this game.</p>
<p>Since the function <code>_ready</code> contains only <code>pass</code>, and <code>_process</code> is commented out, these functions don&rsquo;t do anything now.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the gameplay loop again. The game takes decisions based on the state of the game. We need a way to store the game&rsquo;s state.</p>
<h3 id="storing-the-state-of-the-game">Storing the state of the game</h3>
<p>What information would we like to save in a state? Given the state, we must be able to accurately make the decisions in our gameplay flowchart. We must be able to tell if someone has won, if the game has drawn or if it is still going on. In the last case, we must also be able to tell whose turn it is to play. We need to know the state of each cell in order to determine if someone has drawn or not.</p>
<p>We will save the following information in our state:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>game_started</code>: Is a game in progress? If yes, then we need to listen for clicks and check for wins and draws. Otherwise, we need to show a &ldquo;Start New Game&rdquo; button.</li>
<li><code>turns_played</code>: How many turns have been played so far? This value will help us check whether all cells have been filled, in which case the game has ended.</li>
<li><code>player_turn</code>: We would like to store whose turn it is to play now. We will use this to determine if the next click should add an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or an &ldquo;O&rdquo;. We will also display this information to the players.</li>
<li><code>cells</code>: For each cell in the grid, we need to store whether it is empty, has an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or an &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each property, we will declare the variable and initialise it.
We will declare the variables outside <code>_ready</code> so we can access them in other functions.
We will initialise our variables in <code>_ready</code>.</p>
<h4 id="game_started"><code>game_started</code></h4>
<p>This variable tells us if a game is in progress.
Once the scene is loaded, we are ready to play. We should begin listening for clicks and check for wins. We set <code>game_started</code> is <code>true</code> in <code>_ready</code>.</p>

<p>The variable <code>player_turn</code> will store the name of the player whose turn it is to play. While we can give these players any name we wish, let&rsquo;s call them player <code>1</code> and player <code>-1</code>.
This choice will make our work in the future easier.</p>
<p>Player <code>1</code> will play first and will place X&rsquo;s. Player <code>-1</code> will go second and will place O&rsquo;s.

<p>Let&rsquo;s write a function <code>change_player</code> function that changes the state of <code>player_turn</code>.
We need to care about the details of how we change the player in this function only. Then, any time we want to change the player, we can call <code>change_player</code> without having to know how it works.
This is called <NavExtLink to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns">separation of concerns</NavExtLink>, and helps keep our code organised.</p>

<h4 id="cells"><code>cells</code></h4>
<p>We need to store the state of each cell in the grid.
The variable <code>cells</code> will be an array in which we store references to all <code>GridCell</code> nodes.
We store these in an array so we can access them easily.
We will be able to read/edit the properties of the nodes using these references.</p>
<p>We get a reference to a node using the <code>get_node</code> method. To access a node, we pass the path of the node relative to the current node (the node that the script is attached to) to <code>get_node</code>.</p>

<p>Since accessing nodes is a common pattern in Godot, there is a shorthand notation for it. We can write <code>$Grid/GridSprite</code> instead of <code>get_node(&quot;Grid/GridSprite&quot;)</code>. We will follow this shorter notation from now on.</p>

<p>Once we have a reference to a node, we can manipulate it. Any changes that we can make in the Inspector tab, we can also make in our script. If you hover your mouse over any property in the inspector tab, you will see the name of the property that you can use in scripts.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to hide the <code>GridSprite</code> when the game starts, you can do the following:</p>

This is how we can control nodes from our scripts.
(Let&rsquo;s undo this so the grid is visible when you play the game.)</p>
<p>Now that we know how to access the <code>GridCell</code> nodes, we might try something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">_ready</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The resulting code is much cleaner.
We have references to each <code>GridCell</code> node. Now, we need to save information in each node. We use a script!</p>
<p>Attach a script to the <code>GridCell</code> scene.
This creates a script with the name <code>GridCell.gd</code>. Delete everything except the first line <code>extends Area2D</code>.</p>
<p>For each cell, we want to store if it is empty, or has an X or an O. Let&rsquo;s store this information in a variable named <code>value</code>.
Continuing our notation with the player names, a cell with an &ldquo;X&rdquo; has <code>value</code> equal to <code>1</code> and a cell with an &ldquo;O&rdquo; has <code>value</code> <code>-1</code>. Cells can also be empty. Let empty cells have <code>value</code> <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Declare the <code>value</code> variable in <code>GridCell.gd</code>:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, every <code>GridCell</code> node has a property named <code>value</code>. If you can access a <code>GridCell</code> node, you can also access its <code>value</code> property.
For example, in <code>Game.gd</code>, <code>cells[0]</code> holds a reference to <code>GridCell1</code>. We can access its <code>value</code> variable with <code>cells[0].value</code>. We can now read and edit the <code>value</code> of any <code>GridCell</code> node.</p>
<p>We can use the <code>print</code> method to read the value during development. The output of <code>print</code> is shown in the Output tab (below the code editor).</p>

<p>As you have seen, signals are a very important concept in game development. We will now see how to implement this in Godot.</p>
<p>Nodes in Godot can emit signals when certain events occur.
Each node in Godot has some signals predefined in them. You can see the signals defined for any node by clicking on the Node tab next to the Inspector tab.</p>

</aside>
<p>We can also make our own custom signals.
For example, in our game, we can make a signal named <code>cell_clicked</code> for <code>GridCell</code>. We do this by declaring it in <code>GridCell.gd</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">signal</span> <span class="n">cell_clicked</span>

    </div>
</aside>
<p>Nodes can also listen for signals.
We want the <code>Game</code> node to listen for the <code>cell_clicked</code> signal emitted by a <code>GridCell</code> node.
We use the <code>connect</code> method to listen for signals. The syntax for connecting signals is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="n">SOURCE_NODE</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">SIGNAL_NAME</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">TARGET_NODE</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">METHOD_NAME</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The way to read this is if when the <code>SOURCE_NODE</code> emits the <code>SIGNAL_NAME</code> signal, the <code>TARGET_NODE</code> calls the <code>METHOD_NAME</code> method. Let&rsquo;s see this in action for our game.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nf">_ready</span><span class="p">():</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We want to listen for signals from every cell in the grid, so we have a <code>for</code> loop that iterates over all cells in the grid.
For each cell, when the <code>cell</code> node emits the <code>cell_clicked</code> signal, the <code>self</code> node (in this case the <code>Game</code> node) calls the <code>play_turn</code> method.</p>
<p>Great, we are almost done. We just need to fix the <code>if cell is clicked</code> statement in <code>GridCell.gd</code>.</p>
<p>How do we check if a cell is clicked? Godot has a predefined signal for it! We can use the <code>input_event</code> signal defined in nodes of type <code>Area2D</code>. If we hover over the name, we see that it is emitted when an input event occurs. What is an input event? We will investigate this soon. First, let&rsquo;s connect this signal.</p>
<p>We have seen how to connect signals using code. We can also use the GUI to connect signals in Godot. Let&rsquo;s see how to do that now.</p>
<p>Select the source node, the node that emits the signal. In our game, it&rsquo;s the <code>GridCell</code> node in the <code>GridCell</code> scene. It is of type <code>Area2D</code>. Open the Node tab, find the <code>input_event</code> signal and click ``Connect&hellip;&rsquo;'.</p>
<p>We must now select the target node, the node that listens for the signal.
We are listening for the signal in the <code>GridCell</code> node as well. This is a case where we connect a node to itself.</p>
<p>Also note the &ldquo;Receiver method&rdquo; field says <code>_on_GridCell_input_event</code>. This is the method that will be called in the target node when the signal is emitted.</p>

<p>Select <code>GridCell</code> and click &ldquo;Connect&rdquo;.
This creates the receiver function <code>_on_GridCell_input_event</code> in <code>GridCell.gd</code> for us.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This code reads a lot like our description of the function. It is almost written in English.</p>
<p>Once a cell is clicked, we disconnect the signal to the node using the <code>disconnect</code> method.
We have introduced many new functions (that we haven&rsquo;t defined yet) to keep concerns separate and make the <code>play_turn</code> method easy to read.</p>
<p>The <code>check_win</code> method will return <code>true</code> if someone has won. In that case, we call the <code>game_over()</code> to clean things up, and <code>return</code> prevents the execution of the remainder of the <code>play_turn</code> method.</p>
<p>If <code>check_win</code> is false, then we check for draws with <code>check_draw</code>. This returns <code>true</code> if the game has drawn. Again, we call <code>game_over()</code> and <code>return</code> out of the <code>play_turn</code> method.</p>
<p>We will first work on <code>cell.setX</code>, <code>cell.setO</code>, and <code>cell.isEmpty</code>. Declare all other methods and write <code>pass</code> in their bodies for now. This suppresses the &ldquo;Method not declared&rdquo; errors while we work on the cell functions.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Since the <code>setX</code> method is related to the cell, we will define it <code>setX</code> in <code>GridCell.gd</code>. This is also why we call it as <code>cell.setX()</code> in <code>Game.gd</code> and not just <code>setX</code>.</p>
<p>For each cell, we store a <code>value</code> and display a sprite.
When we set &ldquo;X&rdquo; in a cell, we must update the <code>value</code> of the cell and change the sprite shown in the cell.
Recall that <code>X</code> has <code>value</code> <code>1</code> and <code>O</code> has value <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>We can change the sprite shown by changing the texture of the <code>CellSymbol</code> node.
We load and access the textures in our scripts using the <code>preload</code> method.</p>

Our setters work!</p>
<p>The text labels are currently static.
We would like to update the labels after each turn. We would like to use the labels to tell the players whether it&rsquo;s &ldquo;X&rdquo; or &ldquo;O&rdquo; to play. Let&rsquo;s write the <code>update_labels</code> method now.</p>
<p>We want to show</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Player ___’s turn&rdquo; in the <code>PlayerTurn</code> label, and</li>
<li>&ldquo;Place an ___&rdquo; in the <code>PlayerInstruction</code> label.</li>
</ul>
<p>We add an &ldquo;X&rdquo; or an &ldquo;O&rdquo; in the blanks depending on whose turn it is. We can implement this in our script using format strings.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="n">player_turn_text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&#34;Player </span><span class="si">%s</span><span class="s2">&#39;s turn&#34;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here, <code>%s</code> acts as a blank. We can add any string in the blank by writing it after a <code>%</code> sign.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-gdscript" data-lang="gdscript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">player_turn_text</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="s2">&#34;X&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This prints &ldquo;Player X&rsquo;s turn&rdquo; and &ldquo;Place an X&rdquo; in the output. The <code>%s</code> in the format strings is replaced by &ldquo;X&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Instead of &ldquo;X&rdquo;, we will replace the <code>%s</code> in the format strings with a variable that depends on the value of <code>player_turn</code>. The variable will be equal to &ldquo;X&rdquo; if <code>player_turn</code> is equal to <code>1</code>, and it will be &ldquo;O&rdquo; if <code>player_turn</code> is <code>-1</code>.</p>
<p>We can do the following.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have used a trick while writing the <code>player_symbols</code> array to make this work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrays are counted starting with 0. Therefore, <code>player_symbols[1]</code> returns &ldquo;X&rdquo;.</li>
<li>We can access arrays from the end using negative indices. The <code>-1</code> index of an array is the last element of the array. Therefore, <code>player_symbols[-1]</code> returns &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</li>
<li>We can set the zeroeth element of the array to anything, as it will never be read.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, when <code>update_labels</code> is called, it updates the labels with the correct text.</p>
<h3 id="checking-for-wins-and-draws">Checking for wins and draws</h3>
<p>If we play the game now, we can keep adding symbols until all cells have been filled. Even then, the labels say it&rsquo;s Player O&rsquo;s turn to play when clearly the game is over. We would like the game to stop once someone has won or the game has drawn, and we would like to display to result on the screen.</p>
<p>Display the name of the winner will be easier if we have a state variable that stores the name of the winner.
If no one has won yet, then <code>winner</code> stores <code>0</code>. Otherwise, it stores <code>1</code> or <code>-1</code> depending on who won.
Let&rsquo;s declare and initialise it.</p>

<h4 id="check_win"><code>check_win</code></h4>
<p>A player wins when they get three of the same symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
There are three rows, three columns, and two diagonals, so we need to check for three in a line in eight lines.</p>
<p>This is where choosing values <code>1</code> and <code>-1</code> for &ldquo;X&rdquo; and &ldquo;O&rdquo; is useful again. To check if someone has won, we calculate the sum of values of each row, column, and diagonal. If any of them is 3 or -3, then we have a winner.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add this in <code>check_win</code>.</p>

<h2 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h2>
<p>Well, almost complete.
We can play the game in Godot. If you had to share it with others, we do not expect them to install Godot to play our game. This is not even possible on mobile. We need to export our game.</p>
<h3 id="exporting-the-game">Exporting the game</h3>
<p>Click on Project -&gt; Export&hellip;</p>
<p>We can now export to Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and the Web.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<p>Some new features that can be added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make it usable on mobile. devices without a keyboard. We can add a play again button.</li>
<li>Undo (This is a bit hard. Store the move history in a stack.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hurray! Make it on your own. Improve it, publish it. Make more games!</p>
