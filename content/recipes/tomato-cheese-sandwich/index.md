If you want to eat a tasty sandwich but don't have mint chutney on hand, I have discovered that this combination of red chilli powder, black pepper powder, and chaat masala works wonders.

The following recipe makes one sandwich. It takes less than 5 minutes to make one.

## Ingredients

- 2 slices of sliced multigrain bread
- 1 tomato
- 1 cheese slice
- 1 tsp Red chilli powder
- 1 tsp Black pepper powder
- 1 tsp Chaat masala
- A pinch of rock salt

## Directions

1. Cut moderately thin slices of tomatoes and arrange on a slice of bread.
1. Sprinkle rock salt, red chilli powder, black pepper powder, and chaat masala on the tomatoes.
1. Place a slice of cheese, cover with a slice of bread, and cut diagonally into two triangles.
1. Enjoy your tomato cheese sandwich!

## Tips

- The cheese slice absorbs some spiciness, so don't be afraid to add the spices.
