If you want to eat a tasty sandwich but don't have mint chutney on hand, I have discovered that a combination of red chilli powder, black pepper powder, and chaat masala works wonders.

The following recipe makes one sandwich. It takes less than 5 minutes to make one.

## Ingredients

- 2 slices of sliced multigrain bread
- 1 tomato
- 1 cheese slice
- 1 tsp of red chilli powder
- 1 tsp of black pepper powder
- 1 tsp of chaat masala
- A pinch of rock salt

## Directions

1. Cut moderately thin slices of tomato and arrange them on a slice of bread. (Since this sandwich has only tomatoes and no other filling, I am generous with the tomatoes. I add 6-10 slices depending on the size of the tomato.)
2. Sprinkle rock salt, red chilli powder, black pepper powder, and chaat masala on the tomatoes.

4. Enjoy your tomato cheese sandwich!

## Tips

- The cheese slice absorbs some spiciness, so don't be afraid to add the spices.
- You may use brown bread (whole wheat bread) if multigrain bread is not available.
- You can experiment with different types of breads, cheeses, and spices.
