In the hot Mumbai summertime, it is refreshing to eat cool watermelon and it is cool to eat refreshing mango.
I like mango and I love watermelon, so I decided to have them together. 
I found that they complement each other well.

The mangoes give it a rich and sweet taste, the watermelon keeps it cool, the basil brings in a hint of freshness, and the peanuts provide a satisfying crunch.
I hope you make this yourself and like it!
