It is peak summer time in Mumbai right now, which means that it is mango season!
I wanted to eat a new kind of a sandwich, and this is what I came up with. 
This sandwich contains mangoes and mint leaves and basil leaves.
The mangoes give it a rich and sweet taste, while the herbs bring in a hint of freshness.
It makes for a quick, easy, and tasty meal for the summer.
I hope you try making this yourself and like it!

The following recipe makes one mango sandwich.

## Ingredients

- 3 basil leaves
- 2 teaspoons of butter (optional)
- A pinch of red chilli powder (optional)

- You may use whole-wheat bread if multigrain bread is not available.
- You may experiment with different herbs that you have at hand.
