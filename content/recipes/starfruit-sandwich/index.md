One day, many moons ago, I went out in Bangalore for a long walk and bought an assortment of groceries from different parts of the city: Organic spinach bread, starfruits, tomatoes, cheese cubes, rock salt, and a knife.

When I returned to my room, I tried to make a sandwich from what I had bought. The result: A delicious juicy sandwich with a variety of tastes and textures that is also easy to make.

The following recipe makes one sandwich. Two or three such sandwiches would make a meal.

## Ingredients

- 2 slices of sliced bread (preferably spinach bread)
- 1 starfruit
- 1 tomato
- 1 cheese cube of 20g
- Rock salt
- Pringles (optional)

## Directions

1. Cut a tomato into two halves. Cut one half into four slices. Keep the other half aside.
1. Arrange the tomato slices on a slice of bread.
1. Sprinkle some rock salt on the tomato slices.
1. Cut a starfruit into thin slices.
1. Place five starfruit slices in the shape of a star on the tomatoes. Keep the remaining slices aside.

1. Sprinkle some rock salt on the starfuit slices.
1. Cut a quarter of the cheese cube and keep it aside. Slice the remaining cube and place the slices over the starfruit.
1. Cover with a slice of bread, and cut diagonally into two triangles.

1. Enjoy your starfruit sandwich! Intersperse with bites of tomato, starfruit, and cheese that you had kept aside.
   Optionally, consume some [hyperbolic paraboloid potato-based crisps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pringles) on the side.

## Tips

- Starfruit seeds are soft and are easily cut with a knife. Inspect the starfruit slices closely and make sure that you remove all seed fragments from the slices. A starfruit typically has 4-6 seeds in it.
- If you don't have spinach bread, you may use whole wheat bread or multigrain bread instead. You can apply some mint chutney to the bread slices to make it tastier.
- If you don't have starfruit available, you may use a cucumber instead. However, this is not as much fun.
