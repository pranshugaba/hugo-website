I recently read a paper titled _Infinite Games with Perfect Information_ written by Gale and Stewart in 1953. In this paper, they consider two-player games that may go on forever. There is no hidden information: both player know the rules and the state of the game at all points of time. 

They showed that there exist games that are not strictly determined. They then tried to characterize games that are determined. I found this really interesting, and I want to share some of the results from the paper.    

## Representing games as trees

A game is represented by an infinite rooted tree $T$. Each vertex of the tree corresponds to a position of the game. Each vertex belong to either player 1 or player 2. A play of the game corresponds to an infinite traversal of states in the tree. 

An objective for player 1 is a set of plays.
