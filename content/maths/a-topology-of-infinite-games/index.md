I recently read a 1953 paper titled _Infinite Games with Perfect Information_ by Gale and Stewart. In this paper, they consider two-player games that are played in turns, and may potentially go on for infinitely many turns. By perfect information, they mean that there is no hidden information in the game: both player know the rules and the state of the game at all times. 


They encode a game as a set $X$ of positions, or states or configurations. For example in chess, the state of the game is completely described by the position of the pieces, whether the players have castled, and whose turn it is to play next. Unlike chess, we do not require that both players play alternating turns in our games. 

The players have _strategies_ that determine how they would play when it's their turn. A player has a _winning strategy_ if they can always win irrespective of which strategy the other player employs. Of course, it is not possible for both players to have a winning strategy. However, a surprising result is that there exist games where neither of the players has a winning strategy. 

They showed that there exist games that are not strictly determined. They then tried to characterize games that are determined. I found this really interesting, and I want to share some of the results from the paper.    

## Representing games as trees

A game is represented by an infinite rooted tree $T$. Each vertex of the tree corresponds to a position of the game. Each vertex belong to either player 1 or player 2. A play of the game corresponds to an infinite traversal of states in the tree. 

An objective for player 1 is a set of plays.

## An infinite game that is not determined

## A topology of games

We consider a topology generated by _cones_.

If you found this interesting, I recommend that you give the original paper a read. A follow up is a paper by Donald Martin where he proves that all Borel games are determined.
