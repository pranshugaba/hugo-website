As part of my research on stochastic games with mean-payoff objectives, I read a paper titled _Infinite games with perfect information_[^1] by Gale and Stewart. I would like to discuss some interesting properties of a topology defined on the Cantor set. 

[^1]: Gale and Stewart

A two-player game with perfect information is defined as an infinite rooted tree. We have a set of positions $X$.
