As part of my research on on stochastic games with mean-payoff objectives, I read a paper titled "Infinite games with perfect information" by Gale and Stewart. I would like to discuss some interesting properties of a topology defined on the Cantor set.

A two-player game with perfect information is defined as an infinite rooted tree.
