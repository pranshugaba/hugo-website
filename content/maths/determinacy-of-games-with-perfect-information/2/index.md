## Finite games are determined

## An infinite game that is not determined

The paper shows an example of a infinite game that is not determined. For every strategy $\sigma$ of Player 1, Player 2 has a strategy such that the resulting play is winning for Player 2. Similarly, no matter what strategy Player 2 picks, Player 1 has a strategy such that they win the game. In other words, none of the players have a winning strategy. The game goes as follows:

## A topology of games

We consider a topology generated by _cones_.

## Some examples of determined games

A game is called open if the objective set of Player 1 is open.

Theorem: Open games are determined.

## Conclusion

If you found this interesting, I recommend that you give the original paper a read. You may also read a follow up paper by Donald Martin[^mar75] where he proves that all Borel games are determined.
