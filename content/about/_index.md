## About me

Hi, I'm Pranshu. I am currently a second-year PhD student in the [School of Technology and Computer Science](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in) at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/).
My research interests include Logic, Automata, and Games, as well as Algebra and Combinatorics.
Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/).

### Extracurricular Activities

I like to [walk]({{< ref "/tags/walking" >}}) or [cycle]({{< ref "/tags/cycling" >}}) around the city and explore new places. I like to do some street [photography]({{< ref "/poems" >}}), eat street food, and play with street cats and dogs on the way.

I like to write [puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}). While I enjoy solving puzzles --- I occasionally solve problems on Project Euler --- I enjoy creating puzzles even more. Writing a puzzle that others would find interesting and would want to solve is very challenging indeed.

I love programming. I have previously dabbled with Kotlin and Haskell, and I am currently learning Rust. I would like to make CLI and GUI applications and games using Rust. I also love doing front-end web development (CSS).

In my free time, I [read books]({{< ref "/now#reading" >}}), [watch TV series]({{< ref "/now#watching" >}}), or play bullet chess (1+0) on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).
