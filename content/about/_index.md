## About me

Hi, I'm Pranshu  :wave:


### Education
#### TIFR, Mumbai
I am a final-year PhD research scholar in the [School of Technology and Computer Science](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in) at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/).
I am working on Formal Methods with my advisor [Shibashis Guha](https://www.tifr.res.in/~shibashis.guha/), and am co-advised by [Laurent Doyen](http://www.lsv.fr/~doyen/).
My areas of interest include [reactive synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_synthesis) and [games on graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10546).

Some relevant courses that I have taken include 
- Logic, Automata, and Games
- Descriptive Complexity
- Algebraic Automata Theory
- Computational Complexity
- Algebra and Computation
- Online Algorithms

#### IISc, Bangalore
Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) from 2016 to 2020.
Some courses that I took in IISc include  
- Automata and Computability 
- Introduction to Scalable Systems
- Game theory 
- Graph theory 
- Combinatorics 
- Algebra I and II 
- Topology 
- Measure theory
- Graphics and Visualization

### Hobbies

I like to [walk]({{< ref "/tags/walking" >}}) or [cycle]({{< ref "/tags/cycling" >}}) around the city and explore new places. I like to do some street [photography]({{< ref "/photos" >}}), eat street food, and play with street cats and dogs on the way.

I like to write [puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}). While I enjoy solving puzzles --- I occasionally solve problems on Project Euler --- I enjoy creating puzzles even more. Writing a puzzle that others would find interesting and would want to solve is very challenging indeed.

I love programming. 
I have previously dabbled with functional programming in Haskell as well as Android app development in Kotlin. 
I am currently learning game development using the Godot game engine.

In my free time, I [read books]({{< ref "/now#reading" >}}), solve the [New York Times crossword](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) and [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee), or play bullet chess (1+0) on [lichess.org](https://lichess.org).
