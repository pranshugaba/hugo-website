subtitle: Hi, I am Pranshu!
summary: A little bit about me
---


I am a second-year PhD student in the [School of Technology and Computer Science](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in) at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/).
Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/).

My research interests include Logic, Automata, and Games, as well as Algebra and Combinatorics.

Outside of academics, I like to write [poems]({{< ref "/poems" >}}) and [puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}). I also love photography, swimming, and [cycling](../tags/cycling).
