## me

Hi, I am Pranshu! I am currently a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/). Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in).
My research interests include Automata Theory, Logic, Discrete Maths, and Algorithms.

I create photopoetry, create puzzles, draw comics, develop apps and games, and write stories.

I also love playing chess, solving puzzles, swimming and cycling but not both at once.
