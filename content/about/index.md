subtitle: Hi, I am Pranshu!
summary: A little bit about me
---


I am a PhD student in the [School of Technology and Computer Science](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in) at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/).
Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/).

My research interests include Automata Theory, Algebra, Logic, Combinatorics, and Algorithms.

I write [poems]({{< ref "/poems" >}}) and [puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}), and develop apps and games. I also love photography, swimming and cycling but not both at once.

### Uses

I try to use free and open source software as much as possible. I find that in most cases it is better than the non-free proprietary alternatives.
