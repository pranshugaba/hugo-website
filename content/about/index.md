subtitle: Hi, I am Pranshu!
summary: A little bit about me
---

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/). Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in). My research interests include Automata Theory, Logic, Discrete Maths, and Algorithms.

I write [poems]({{< ref "/poems" >}}) and [puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}), and develop apps and games. I also love photography, swimming and cycling but not both at once.

[See what I am doing now]({{< ref "/now" >}}).
