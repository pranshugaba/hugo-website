{{< hero position="img__right" image="yellow" alt="Pranshu stands holding a yellow umbrella in front of yellow flowers.">}}

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/). 
Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in). 

My research interests include Automata Theory, Logic, Discrete Maths, and Algorithms.

I write [poems]({{< ref "/poems" >}}) and [puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}), and develop apps and games. I also love photography, swimming and cycling but not both at once.

### Uses

I try to use free and open source software as much as possible. I find that in most cases it is better than the non-free proprietary alternatives.
