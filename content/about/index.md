title: About me
subtitle: Hi, I am Pranshu!
summary: A little bit about me and my website
---

I am currently a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in/). Previously, I did my undergraduate studies in Maths at [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in).
My research interests include Automata Theory, Logic, Discrete Maths, and Algorithms.

I write [poems]({{< ref "/poems" >}}) and [puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}), and develop apps and games. 
I also love playing chess, solving puzzles, swimming and cycling but not both at once.

I am currently reading {{< currently-reading >}} See my [recent reads]({{< ref "/reads" >}}).
