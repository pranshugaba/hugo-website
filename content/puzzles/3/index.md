## The Problem

You are organising a chess tournament! 
All was going well until the clock struck one, when all players left their games midway and headed for lunch! When they returned, they found to their dismay, they had all forgotten whose turn it was to play. 
Can you help them figure out whose turn is it to play?

For each game, you know the position of the pieces and nothing else. You have to decide whether it's white to play or black to play. 
You can assume that both players have been playing legal chess moves.

### Game 1
This position looks the starting position of a standard chess game. 

{{< chessboard fen="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR" caption="All pieces are in the initial position.">}}

A standard chess game begins with white to play. But by just looking at this position, can you tell if the game hasn't begun. or is possible that the players have played some moves have arrived back at the initial position.

Who plays next?
