## The Problem
Today's puzzle is simple. I present some chess positions. For each position, you must decide whether it's white or black to play. 

### 1
Which player's turn is it to play?

{{< chessboard fen="123" caption="This is a _caption_." >}}

### 2
What is the maximum number of knights you can place on an $8 \times 8$ chessboard such that no two knights attack each other? 

{{< insert-svg filename="starting-position" caption="Starting position">}}

This is a starting position. White goes first.
