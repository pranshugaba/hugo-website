## The Problem

You were organising a chess tournament. 
When the clock struck one, all players left their games and went for lunch! They didn't keep a record of the game, and when they returned, they didn't know whose turn it was to play. 
Can you help them out?

Assuming the games have been played, 
For each game, you have to decide whether it's white to play or black to play. 


### Game 1
This position looks the starting position of a standard chess game. 

{{< chessboard fen="rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR" caption="All pieces are in the initial position.">}}

A standard chess game begins with white to play. But by just looking at this position, can you tell if the game hasn't begun. or is possible that the players have played some moves have arrived back at the initial position.

Who plays next?
