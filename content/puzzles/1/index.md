Introducing [Mardi Maths](/mardi-maths): a new series where I share interesting maths puzzles every other Tuesday. Interesting and enlightening reader-submitted solutions will be featured along with the following puzzle.

Here's the first puzzle of the series. 


## The Problem
You have stolen an exquisite painting from your local art gallery, and given the daring thief that you are, you would like to hang in your living room! You have with you some nails and a long rope.


### Level 1


You would like to hang the painting using two nails. To allow for easy removal, you want the painting to fall if you remove any one of the nails from the wall.


 Is this feat possible? If yes, then how would you hang the painting? If no, then prove that it is impossible.


 *Tip:* Try it out with some pencils and a long string.

{{< figure class="float-right" src="two_nails.png" alt="A painting hanging off two nails."  caption="The method shown in the figure _does not_ work, because if you remove any one nail, the painting still hangs from the other nail." >}}

### Level 2
Now suppose you want to hang the painting using $n$ nails. You would like to painting to fall on removing any one nail.

For what values of $n$ is this possible? 
In the cases it is possible, how would you hang the painting?


### Level 3
Suppose you want to hang the painting using $n$ nails. This time, you would like the painting to fall on removing any $m$ nails. The painting should not fall if you remove fewer than $m$ nails.
You may assume $1 \le m \le n$. 

For what values of $m$ and $n$ is this possible? 
In the cases it is possible, how would you go about hanging the painting?

Good luck, have fun!
