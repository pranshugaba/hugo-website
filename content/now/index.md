## TIFR

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/). 
I am attending the following courses this semester:
- Algebra and Computation
- Computational Complexity
- Logic, Games, and Automata (from CMI)
- Algebraic Automata Theory (from CMI)


## Learning

I am learning [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) by reading the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and solving the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) exercises. I am currently trying to implement the [PNGme](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/) project. 

मी मराठी पण शिकतोय.
I am learning Marathi from [learn-marathi.com](https://www.learn-marathi.com/courses).

## Reading

## Watching

I am currently watching Barry and Gravity Falls. 

I also love watching British panel shows such as I Literally Just Told You, 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown, and Would I Lie to You?. 

[See my watch list &#8594;]({{< ref "/watches" >}})

## Gaming

I started playing Dark Souls recently. It's tough and I am dying a lot, but that should be no surprise. I can feel myself getting better at the game, albeit gradually, with every death.
