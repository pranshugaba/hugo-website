## TIFR

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/). I am working on a project on Stochastic Window Mean-payoff Games with [Prof.&nbsp;Shibashis&nbsp;Guha](https://www.tifr.res.in/~shibashis.guha/).

I am attending the following courses this semester:
- Algebra and Computation
- Topics in the study of Markov chains
- Computational Complexity


## Learning

I am learning functional programming with Haskell from _Programming in Haskell_ by Graham Hutton. I want to become proficient enough in Haskell to be able to solve puzzles on Project Euler, as well as configure [XMonad](https://xmonad.org/) --- the window manager that I use.

I am learning to build Android apps using Jetpack Compose. I am putting this knowledge into practice by making an app called _Decimal Clock_. You can [get it from the Play Store](https://tenhourstudios.com/decimal-clock).

मी मराठी पण शिकतोय.
I am learning Marathi from [learn-marathi.com](https://www.learn-marathi.com/courses).

## Reading
I am currently reading _The Magus_ by John Fowles.

[See my reading list &#8594;]({{< ref "/reads" >}})

## Watching

I am currently watching The Righteous Gemstones and Gravity Falls. 

I also love watching British TV shows such as I Literally Just Told You, 8 out of 10 Cats does Countdown, and Would I Lie to You?. 

[See my watch list &#8594;]({{< ref "/watches" >}})

## Gaming

I started playing Dark Souls recently. It's tough and I am dying a lot, but that should be no surprise. I can feel myself getting better at the game, albeit gradually, with every death.
