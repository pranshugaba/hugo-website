## PhD
I am a fifth-year PhD research scholar in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/).
I am working on Formal Methods with my advisor [Shibashis Guha](https://www.tifr.res.in/~shibashis.guha/), and am co-advised by [Laurent Doyen](http://www.lsv.fr/~doyen/).
My areas of interest include [reactive synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_synthesis) and [games on graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10546).
