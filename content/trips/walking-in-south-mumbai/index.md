I have my qualifier exams tomorrow, and my pen is almost out of ink. I wanted to buy a refill, but the general store in TIFR does not stock refills for the pen that I use. So I decided to walk to a stationery store in Colaba market and buy a refill. 

The nearest stationery store is 3 kilometres from TIFR, and a round trip to the store would have been just over 6 kilometres. However, I felt like doing some sightseeing, and I ended up walking more than 14 kilometres.

Here's the route that I walked and some pictures that I took. It's mostly cats and buildings, but there's also a dog and some reptiles.
