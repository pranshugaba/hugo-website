It had been more than two years since [I last cycled home from TIFR]({{< ref "/trips/cycling-home-from-tifr/">}}). I left at 5.47 am and reached home by 8.15 am.

I am pleasantly surprised that it takes me almost the same time by cycle as it takes by public transport (bus + train + bus).

On the way, I sighted the Incredible Hulk, tandem bicycle bunnies, and a beautiful sunrise!

Here is the route that I took and some photos that I captured along the way!
