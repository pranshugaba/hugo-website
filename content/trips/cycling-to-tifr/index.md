I want to cycle more in South Mumbai, so I needed to get my cycle from my home to TIFR. I could have gone by train, but cycling is more fun!

It was an exciting but exhausting ride. I left at 5.20 am and reached TIFR at 8.35 am. I mainly cycled along S V road and Dr. Annie Besant road.

I got to see a rainbow on the way!
