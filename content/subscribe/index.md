## Newsletter

I publish a weekly newsletter in which I share updates. Here are links to some of the recent issues:

{{< recent-newsletters >}}

There are three ways to access my newsletter. Pick your favourite:

1. You can sign up at http://newsletter.pranshugaba.com and get the latest issue emailed straight to your inbox. (If you have subscribed but are not receiving newsletter emails, they are probably going to your spam folder. Mark these emails as "not spam" so that future issues will not go in spam.)
1. Alternatively, if you do not wish to share your email id, you could add the following feed to your favourite feed reader. 

    ```
    https://pranshugaba.com/newsletters/index.xml
    ```
    You will be notified by your reader when a new issue is uploaded.

1. All issues will also be available on my website at [https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter]({{< ref "/newsletter" >}}). You can bookmark this page and browse through it anytime you like.


## RSS Feeds

If you prefer to read on a feed reader, here are some RSS feeds. (Note that some components and figures may not render correctly in your feed reader.)

Subscribe to everything all in one feed.

```shell
https://pranshugaba.com/index.xml
```

### Feed readers

I recommend [newsboat](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat) if you are on Linux, and [NiceFeed](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.joshuacerdenia.android.nicefeed/) for Android.

### Sections
If you are only interested in subscribing to certain sections, you can do that as well. Here are the section wise feeds:

- [posts](/posts/index.xml)
- [trips](/trips/index.xml)
- [recipes](/recipes/index.xml)
- [puzzles](/puzzles/index.xml)
- [poems](/poems/index.xml)
- [stories](/stories/index.xml)
- [comics](/comics/index.xml)
- [dev](/dev/index.xml)
- [minis](/minis/index.xml)
- [thoughts](/thoughts/index.xml)

### Tags

To subscribe to a specific tag, append `/index.xml` to the URL of the tag page to get the URL for the corresponding feed.

For example, say you would like to follow the `haiku` tag. It is available at

```shell
https://pranshugaba.com/tags/haiku
```

The feed corresponding to this tag is at

```shell
https://pranshugaba.com/tags/haiku/index.xml
```
