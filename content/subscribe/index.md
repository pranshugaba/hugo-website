Subscribe to everything on my website with the following feed.

```shell

```

Feed readers are great way to access feeds of your favourite sites in one place. 
- If you are using Linux, then I recommend [Feeds](https://gfeeds.gabmus.org/) (a graphical application) or [newsboat](https://github.com/newsboat/newsboat) (a command-line application).
- If you use an Android device, then [Read You](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.ash.reader/) is an excellent feed reader. 

Once you add a feed to a feed reader, you will be able to read my posts in the feed reader itself.
Feed readers keep track of which pages you have already read, and can also notify you when a new post is uploaded.


## Feeds by categories

Here are some feeds for other parts of my website. (Note that some components and figures may not render correctly in your feed reader.)
You can always open the webpage from the feed reader to see correctly rendered content.

If you are only interested in subscribing to certain sections, you can do that as well. Here are the section wise feeds:

### Articles

https://pranshugaba.com/articles/index.xml

```

```

```

## Feeds by tags

You can also browse pages on my website by [tags]({{< ref "/tags" >}}).
If you are interested in a particular tag and would like to subscribe to it, append `/index.xml` to the URL of the tag page to get the URL for the corresponding feed.

For example, say you would like to follow the `haiku` tag which is available at the following URL.

```shell
https://pranshugaba.com/tags/haiku
```

The feed corresponding to this tag is at

```shell
https://pranshugaba.com/tags/haiku/index.xml
```

This feed will only consist of all pages containing the tag `haiku`.
