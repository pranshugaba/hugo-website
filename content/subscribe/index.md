## Newsletter feed

I publish a weekly newsletter in which I share updates. Here are links to some of the recent issues:

{{< recent-newsletters >}}

Add the following feed to your favourite feed reader.

```shell
https://pranshugaba.com/newsletters/index.xml
```

You will be notified by your reader when a new issue is uploaded.  
[Read how to use feed readers &#8594;]({{< ref "/subscribe#feed-readers" >}})

All past issues are also available to read on this website at [https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter]({{< ref "/newsletter" >}}). You can bookmark this page and browse through it anytime you like.

## Other feeds

Here are some RSS feeds for other parts of my website. (Note that some components and figures may not render correctly in your feed reader.)

### Everything

Subscribe to everything on my website with the following feed.

```shell

### Tags

You can browse pages on my website by [tags]({{< ref "/tags" >}}).
If you are interested in a particular tag and would like to subsribe to it, append `/index.xml` to the URL of the tag page to get the URL for the corresponding feed.

For example, say you would like to follow the `haiku` tag. It is available at

```shell

The feed corresponding to this tag is at
