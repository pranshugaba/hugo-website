After being in development for years, version 4.0 of [the game engine Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chXAjMQrcZk) was released this week. 
It is a big release and I am excited to try it out! 
Nathan from GDQuest posted an half-hour long video describing the highlights of [what's new in this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chXAjMQrcZk). 
You can read more about the release on [the official blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/). 

The courses on GDQuest are an excellent resource to learn game development with Godot. 
There is a 50% off sale going on because of this special occasion till March 8. 
Check it out if you are interested in learning how to make games.

In related news, version 0.10 of [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), another game engine, was [released today](https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/). 
Bevy is written in Rust, which means that you can use Bevy to make _blazingly fast_ games.
