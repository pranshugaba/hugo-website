After being in development for years, version 4.0 of [the game engine Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chXAjMQrcZk) was released today. 
It is a big release and I am excited to try it out! 
Nathan from GDQuest posted an half-hour long video describing the highlights of [what's new in this version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chXAjMQrcZk). 
You can read more about the release on [the official blog post](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-0-sets-sail/). 

The courses on GDQuest are an excellent resource to learn game development with Godot. 
There is a 50% off sale going on because of this special occasion till March 8. 
Check it out if you are interested in learning how to make games.

Version 0.10 of Bevy was also released. 
It looks very promising. Blazingly fast games.
