Hello there!

Welcome to my brand-new weekly newsletter.
Yes, I am starting a newsletter and this is the very first issue.
Each issue will include updates about what's new on this site and what's new with me.
I will also share links, quotes, music, videos, etc. that I encountered in the past week that I liked.
I hope you enjoy the newsletter and find it useful / interesting / fun!

I will upload a new issue every Saturday. You can sign up at http://newsletter.pranshugaba.com and get the latest issue emailed straight to your inbox.
Alternatively, if you do not wish to share your email id, you could add the following feed to your favourite feed reader and you will be notified by your reader when a new issue is uploaded.

All issues will also be available on my website at [https://pranshugaba.com/newsletter]({{< ref "/newsletter" >}}). You can bookmark this page and browse through it anytime you like.

## What's new on my site

- I shared [a picture of the Gateway of India]({{< ref "/minis/9" >}}) which was lit up beautifully on Thursday.
- I wrote a photopoem called _sunset_.

  [Read the accompanying poem &#8594;]({{< ref "/poems/sunset" >}})
- I wrote this issue of the newsletter, and set up my website to be able to add more issues! (sorry, this is getting meta...)

## What's new with me

- My batchmates from TIFR and I are conducting a Chai and Why session on <time datetime="2022-05-29T11:00:00+05:30">Sunday, May 29 (tomorrow) at 11 am</time>. It will be an hour-long interactive session where we explore puzzles related to graph theory. The venue is [Ruparel College, Matunga West, Mumbai](https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/978614999). You can drop by if you are around, or you can [watch it live on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qakLY2e_YMo).
- [I went to a book fair]({{< ref "/minis/7" >}}) and bought some books by weight, and then [went to a book store]({{< ref "/minis/8" >}}) and bought some more books.
- I started playing the overwhelmingly positively rated puzzle game [_Baba is You_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Is_You). I have only played the first 15 levels, but the concept is amazing and I have never seen anything like it before. In this game, you move around blocks to change the rules of the game to be able to clear each level. It's brilliant.
- I began reading _Following the Equator_ by Mark Twain. It is humorous and informative. You will find an excerpt from the book below. [Also see my reading list &#8594;]({{< ref "/reads" >}})

## Curated content

Here are some titbits that I found this week that you might enjoy.

### Some YouTube videos

- [Who made these circles in the Sahara?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twAP3buj9Og) is an excellent video by Vox. Inspired by a peculiar observation made by a Redditor while browsing Google Earth, [Christophe Hausbursin](https://www.vox.com/authors/christophe-haubursin) leads an investigation trying to solve the mystery behind the mysterious circles seen in the Saharan desert.
- Two Ryan Georges discuss [how the traps and riddles around ancient relics were designed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwu1rCjb1Fk).
- [Joel Haver has fun standing on a pile of rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o54sGWJd8tg), even though it's not safe.
- And finally, [a joke by Norm MacDonald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v89pVOW2aE).

### A song

_Numb Little Bug_ by Em Beihold  
[Watch on YouTube &#8594;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fwJ8H5wWCU)

### And an excerpt

Mark Twain's take on crossing the International Date Line:

> Sept. 8.---Sunday. We are moving so nearly south that we cross only about two meridians of longitude a day. This morning we were in longitude 178 west from Greenwich, and 57 degrees west from San Francisco. To-morrow we shall be close to the center of the globe---the 180th degree of west longitude and 180th degree of east longitude.
>
> And then we must drop out a day---lose a day out of our lives, a day never to be found again. We shall all die one day earlier than from the beginning of time we were foreordained to die. We shall be a day behindhand all through eternity. We shall always be saying to the other angels, "Fine day today," and they will be always retorting, "But it isn't to-day, it's tomorrow." We shall be in a state of confusion all the time and shall never know what true happiness is.
