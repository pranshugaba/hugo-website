### Excerpts

This second excerpt is much more light-hearted. It is a conversation that Mark Twain had while visiting Fiji in September:

> "This? This is not hot. You ought to be here in the summer time once."
>
> "We supposed that this was summer; it has the ear-marks of it. You could take it to almost any country and deceive people with it. But if it isnâ€™t summer, what does it lack?"
>
> "It lacks half a year. This is mid-winter."
>
> <cite>--- Excerpt from Following the Equator by Mark Twain</cite>

### and Two songs

Here are two songs that have French names and were released in 1979:

- _Main dans la main_ by Ellie et Jacno. [Watch on YouTube &#8594;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SolYdL5tcag)
