Hello there!

I had been busy the last few months writing a research paper. However, now, May is here, the paper is submitted, the semester has ended, and I have some free time on my hands. 

## Some news for you

### Chai and Why
I, along with Varun, Eeshan, and Ashutosh from the School of Technology and Computer Science in TIFR are organizing a fun outreach session of Chai and Why.
Entry is open and free for all! 
See you tomorrow morning at 11, at Prithvi Café, Juhu.
[Read more about the Chai and Why series &#8594;](https://www.tifr.res.in/~outreach/chai_and_why.html)

### New preprint
I have been working on a problem on stochastic games with window mean-payoff objectives with [Laurent Doyen](http://www.lsv.fr/~doyenhiba) and [Shibashis Guha](https://www.tifr.res.in/~shibashis.guha/) for the better part of the past year. 
We finally finished writing the paper and uploaded a preprint on arXiv.org: 
[Stochastic Window Mean-payoff Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11563). 
With this, I now have a page on [dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/345/7987.html)!

### Final Space Ends

When _Final Space_ was unceremoniously cancelled after Season 3 with the biggest cliffhanger ever, it was a very sad day.
The good news now is that the creator of the show, Olan Rogers, is getting a chance to complete the story in the form of a graphic novel. 
I highly recommend that you watch this show. 
If you are outside the US, you can watch it on Netflix till December 2023. 
You can [pre-order the graphic novel](https://finalspaceends.com) to support Olan for what will undoubtedly be an arduous road ahead.
Almost 20,000 copies have already been sold in less than two weeks.

### What's playing
- The Broadway Musical _The Sound of Music_ started playing in Mumbai from May&nbsp;3. I watched it on the opening night and loved it. The acting, singing, and dancing by the cast is phenomenal. The live music by the orchestra was amazing as well.

- For some reason, all eight Harry Potter movies are back in theaters in Mumbai. I missed watching the first four movies in the theaters, so this is a chance to experience them on the big screen.
- Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 released this week as well. While I am no longer interested in the MCU, the reviews for this film are looking positive, and I might go watch it after all.

## Some interesting videos

Here are some videos were uploaded on YouTube in the last week that I liked.

### Quirky keyboards

- A video about the [history of the arrow keys on keyboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BytowtVycc0) by the 8-bit guy. 
Almost every keyboard you can find today has arrow keys (or cursor keys) in an "inverted&nbsp;T" shape. However, this has not always been the case.[^1] 

[^1]: Does it seem strange to see arrow keys in a line? The text editor vim does that. In vim, you can press <kbd>h</kbd>, <kbd>j</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>l</kbd> to move the cursor left, down, up, and right respectively.
I will be posting more tips about vim in the future. 
Once you try vim, you cannot go back. 

- There's something wrong with Joel Haver's friend's keyboard. It's not a typical QWERTY keyboard. He uses the [Blomfu keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWoDSsCX1S8)!


### Marbula One S4

[Season 4 of Marble racing begins!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtXf1yhf01k) It is fun to watch the marbles make laps across the track while listening to the captivating commentary. 

### AI generated memes

YouTuber demonflyingfox became famous last month for creating AI generated videos on [Harry Potter Balenciaga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE39q-IKOzA).
Now they are back with another AI generated video on [Breaking Bad in German](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygWsjr9qhVc). Wandlung zum Bösen!

### Epic NPC man

Here's another epic NPC man video by VLDL. A bug in the programs of two NPC muggers in the town of Honeywood leads to a [hilarious outcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfzGbAh3nNI).


### Elliot is a cool guy

Elliot, a graphic designer, [tries out a bunch of graphic design softwares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAk9SZ9yrMY) to make posters. 
The programs that he tries out include Photoshop, Canva, Inkscape, GIMP, and even Excel. 
My favourite one is of course Inkscape!


### Book graphs

In this episode of Numberphile, James Grimes talks about [book embeddings of graphs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw2Pl_Nk3CA).
These are an interesting generalization of planar graphs. 
The vertices of a graph are placed in a single line that forms the 'spine' of a book.
No two edges between two vertices allowed to intersect. 
We can avoid edge intersections by embedding the edges in different 'pages'.
The problem is, given a graph, to find the minimum number of pages required to embed the graph.
After watching the video, you can also read the [the paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07630).
They show that four pages are sufficient to embed any planar graphs.

That's all for now! See you in the next one. :wave:
