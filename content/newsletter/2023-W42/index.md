Hello there!

I hope you have been doing well in the past few months.
Please enjoy this new issue of my newsletter!
There is a lot that is new on my site and there are many interesting links, some of which you might enjoy.

## What's new with me

### New tablet
I used to use an iPad with an Apple Pencil to jot down notes.
However, the Pencil broke, and buying a new one is not cheap. 
I decided to get a new tablet, an Android this time. 
I am loving it so far. 
I will write a post sharing my experience about the new tab soon. 


### Learning French
One of [my goals this year]({{< ref "/newsletter/2023-W01#languages">}}) has been to learn more languages.
One of the languages I want to get better at is French, or français. 
I had learnt some French in school, but I was not very good at it, and I had forgotten most of it by now anyway.
I started actively learning this language a few months ago.

To improve my writing skills, I will be posting short essays in French here on my site in a section called [_À propos de moi_]({{< ref "/a-propos-de-moi" >}}). 
It means _About me_ in French.
I have written [the first essay]({{< ref "/a-propos-de-moi/on-commence" >}}) already where I briefly introduce myself in French.
I will write about interesting events in my life, as well as document my French learning experience, all of it in French. 
If you a French speaker, please have a read and let me know if you find any mistakes or have suggestions to improve my writing. 


### New photopoems
This week, I posted two new photopoems: [a haiku]({{< ref "/poems/barcode" >}}) and [a limerick]({{< ref "/poems/the-nine-bollards-with-faces" >}}).

### New comic
I had drawn [a comic]({{< ref "/comics/1" >}}) about ghosts a long long time ago, during lockdown. 
The new tablet has inspired me to pick up drawing once again. 
Hence, I have drawn a [new comic]({{< ref "/comics/2" >}}) with the same characters.

### Some more stuff
- I have started reading a novel titled _Riddley Walker_ by Russell Hoban.
It may not look like it is written in English, but it (mostly) makes sense when you read it out aloud.
It takes quite some effort to read and understand it. 
- I have been watching more of British TV panel shows. I am Richard Osman's House of Games (Series 7), Taskmaster (Series 16), Only Connect, and University Challenge (Series 53).
- Monty Python's Holy Grail is rereleasing in theaters. Unfortunately, it's only in theaters in the US and for two days only.

### An excerpt
How far is New Zealand from Australia? The answer may surprise you.

> If it would not look too much like showing off, I would tell the reader where New Zealand is; for he is as I was; he thinks he knows. And he thinks he knows where Hertzegovina is; and how to pronounce pariah; and how to use the word unique without exposing himself to the derision of the dictionary. But in truth, he knows none of these things
<cite>-- Excerpt from Chapter XXVI, Following the Equator by Mark Twain</cite>


Did you say it is close to Australia or Asia? Read on...

> All people think that New Zealand is close to Australia or Asia, or somewhere, and that you cross to it on a bridge. But that is not so. It is not close to anything, but lies by itself, out in the water. It is nearest to Australia, but still not near. The gap between is very wide. It will be a surprise to the reader, as it was to me, to learn that the distance from Australia to New Zealand is really twelve or thirteen hundred miles, and that there is no bridge.
<cite>-- Another excerpt from Chapter XXVI, Following the Equator</cite>

I would recommend that you read the entire chapter, and if possible, even the entire book.
It is not only hilarious, but you will also gain a lot of knowledge about the world as it was in the 17th century.
