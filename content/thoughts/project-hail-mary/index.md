**tldr;** Go and read this book now. You are in for a ride. 

Note: Spoilers for "The Martian" up ahead. 
TODO: Remove Martian spoilers

I finished reading Project Hail Mary today evening. I had enjoyed watching "The Martian" when it had released, and had after hearing nothing but praises about the book "The Martian" too. I wanted to read the book, but having watched the movie, I wasn't so keen about it. It has been a while since I watched it. I hardly remember anything except that Matt Damon was stranded on Mars after his crew left without him, he managed to grow potatoes on Mars and managed to return to Earth. 

I came across a number of absolutely positive reviews for Andy's new book "Project Hail Mary" on Reddit. I knew this book had to be good. I wanted to buy a second hand copy from a bookstore in Fort, but decided to download it on my Kindle and get a taste of the first chapter. It was so addictive and immersive that I ended up reading the whole book in two days. 

Warning: Spoilers for "Project Hail Mary" up ahead. 

This book shared some similarities with the book I had read before this. In both books, the protagonist is stranded in a vessel in an ocean. 

This book had everything. It is one of the best experiences I have ever had. 
While it is technically science fiction, at no point did I doubt that the plausibility of the story. The science always seemed to check out. 

This book has 
scientific thinking, 
linguistics, 
physics, 
relativity, 
chemistry, 
material science, 
problem solving, 
morals, 
ethical dilemmas, 
making it a very rewarding experience. 

The author switches back and forth between the past and the present as a narrative device. The protagonist, (whose name is Dr. Ryland Grace, but it takes a while to remember), wakes up in a spacecraft with no memory of how he got there. Both Ryland and us learn about the Ryland's past together. This helps the story start in the middle of the action, prevents a lot of exposition dump in the beginning, and changes the pace of the story from time to time. 

This book was a roller coaster of emotions. I laughed when Rocky learned sarcasm, I cried when Ryland bade Rocky goodbye. I was ecstatic every time Ryland met a new alien species. I was worried that the alien would be hostile. I was scared when the astrophages were eaten by the Taumoeba. I was hopeful that they would be able to breed nitrogen resistant taumoebae. I was thrilled whenever they would team up and solve a problem that they were facing.

I was worried that Ryland would not be able to breed Taumeoba that would survive Venus's atmosphere but not in Threeworld. Thankfully, this situation did not arise. 

I loved how Ryland manages to communicate with Rocky. The world building is amazing. We get to learn about Rocky's cultures, what are Rocky's species strengths and weaknesses compared to human's. 

The ending seemed a bit abrupt. We don't know what exactly happened on Earth, what was the damage, how many people died, how bad the climate became. But then, neither does Ryland, so it is fine. 

This book is definitely one of the best books I have read so far. 10/10.
