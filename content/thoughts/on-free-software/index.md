Have you read the terms and conditions that you are _forced_ to accept when you install Windows or macOS on a new PC? When you set up a new iPhone or Android device? They look scary because they are so long and written legalese. But once you read it, you will realise how much more worse it actually is. 

You bound to follow the terms and conditions that you "agreed" to, and the companies can punish you if you violate those terms. You sign away many important rights when you click on the agree button. But it does not have to be this way. I would like to introduce to you, if you don't know it already, _free software_.

## What is free software?

Let me begin by clarifying a common misconception. 
The _free_ in the free software stands for free as in freedom, not free as in free of cost. Some languages such as French and Spanish have two different words for the two meanings. 
For example, in Spanish, _gratis_ means free of cost whereas _libre_ means freedom.
Unfortunately, English does not have two different words for free and this leads to confusion sometimes. 

## Freedoms of free software
What sort of freedom would be like from our software? 

You can't go far in free software without reading about Richard P Stallman. Watch this interesting video by Richard Stallman where he explains four kinds of freedoms: the freedom to run software, freedom to distribute it, freedom to look at the code, and freedom to be able to modify it. Let's see how these freedoms are useful and helpful. 

Some examples of non-free software are Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Adobe Creative Suite, iMovie, iOS, macOS, and the list is big. 

### Freedom to run software


I do admit that I have pirated Windows 7 and the Adobe Creative Suite among other applications in the past. It is always risky to install pirated software; you never know there is malware hidden in it. 

I have found that as I have switched to using free software, I no longer feel the need to pirate software, and it feels great. 

### Freedom to look at the code and modify it

When a software is non-free, you can't look at the source code and you can't definitely cannot make changes to it to suit you. It's usually paid, and your left to the whims of the developer. You need to trust the developer. They might be spying on you and selling your data. No one knows, no one will know, it's proprietary software it's closed. By its very nature, it does not promote collaboration.

You might have heard of 'open source' software. While free software is always open source, the converse is not true. Open source does not necessarily mean free software. The Unreal Engine by Epic Games has source available, as in you can browse the code but only if you agree to a restrictive EULA (end-user license agreement). It is not free software. Don't get me wrong, this is better than closed source but it's not much better.

You know what the code you can see the code you know that there is no breach of privacy. There's no telemetry that's spying on you like Windows, macOS, and Android. You are in control of your own data. Even if the company goes rogue (like audacity did recently) you can just leave that and fork the project.


If software has these freedoms then it's good for everyone. Software becomes more accessible and benefits everyone. Free software is usually free of charge but not always.

### Freedom to redistribute software

### Freedom to distribute software

When software is free, people can look at the code and improve it. The more eyes that look at the code to better the code gets. This is not the case with proprietary products. I use KDE Plasma and/or XMonad as my daily driver. You wouldn't believe how customizable it is. The features that are coming to windows and Mac OS today were present for years in the software.

Free software breaks boundaries:
Since it's usually free of cost as well, there's no win someone can't afford it.
Since it's open and free it usually works well on old machines as well. Take a 10-year-old laptop and it's much more likely to be able to run Linux instead of windows. With windows 11 coming out soon, you won't be able to install windows 11 on machines as new as 5-year-old machines.


It gives you control of your machines. How many times has it happened that windows has decided to restart and install updates at unseremonious times? This never happens with free software. Apple making life difficult for you by not giving you a proper file manager it's not free leave that come to the sweet world of Linux and free software.

It helps new developers as well. Thanks to the free and open source software available I have learned a lot about Android programming shell programming fighting programming and so on. If all software was closed, proprietary, it would have been much more difficult for me to learn it.

And I do not need to mention the benefits of software being accessible. With more free software  you can see more people writing more creative code and producing outstandingly software. 


## Common arguments against free software (and why they do not hold)

A common argument is that non-free software is better than free software. You would be surprised how rarely this is true.

Another argument that is often presented is that how are developers supposed to earn a living. Free software does not have to mean free of cost We have charge. People make donations people sponsor free software. We have blender instead of 3DS Max and Maya and cinema 4D.

## Free software today

Free software is making great strides, we have so many online alternatives today that we did not have two decades ago. We have Linux instead of windows, we have LibreOffice to substitute Microsoft office, we have game instead of Photoshop, we also have krita. We have a zathura and ocular and Sumatra instead of Adobe Acrobat reader. We have Firefox instead of Chrome. We have audacity. In chess, we have Lichess instead of chess.com. 

## The future of free software

There has been some outrage recently with windows 11 not being supported on mediumly old devices. I hope this drives people to Linux. The steam deck that's coming out next year and running arch linux and KDE plasma will surely help Linux as well. Hopefully this will be the decade of the Linux desktop haha. No seriously.

### How you can help

The first and the obvious step is to start using free software yourself.
