Published in 1986, the book _It_ by Stephen King is 37 years old now, and yet, it is newer than many of the books I have read recently (Crime and Punishment, Moby Dick, Treasure Island, etc.). 

I had bought this book last year from a book seller on College Street in Kolkata. 
The most scary thing about the book was its size! 
It is 1375 pages big!  It is not just a book, it is a tome. 
I was intially deterred by its size, however, I am glad I picked it up and read it. 
I had not seen the movie prior to reading this book. 
This is the first book by Stephen King that I have read and also the first true horror book that I have ever read. 
The closest thing to horror that I have read before would be the Goosebumps series by R.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Stine. 
I have probably read more than a hundred books in the series. 
While they are marketed as horror and I have enjoyed reading those as well, they were more funny than scary. 

I could feel a Stranger Things-like vibe from the book. 
It seems likely that this book served as inspiration for the Duffer brothers to create Stranger things. 
Derry, Maine does not feel very different from Hawkins, Indiana. 
Both are towns are cursed with deadly supernatural threats and it is upto the kids to save the town.
