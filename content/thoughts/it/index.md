Published in 1986, the book _It_ by Stephen King is 37 years old now, and yet, it is newer than many of the books I have read recently (Crime and Punishment, Moby Dick, Treasure Island, etc.). 

I had bought a copy of the book last year from a roadside book seller on College Street in Kolkata. 
I knew that it is a horror book, and yet, the size of the book scared me! 
It is 1375 pages big!  It is not a book but a tome. 
I was initially deterred by its size, however, I am glad I picked it up and read it. 

This is the first book by Stephen King that I have read and also the first proper horror book that I have read. 
The closest thing to horror that I have read before would be the Goosebumps series by R.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;Stine. 
I have read more than a hundred books in the series. 
While they are marketed as horror, and I have enjoyed reading those as well, they were more funny than scary. 

I read the book without having seen the movie before. 
I know the films star Finn Wolfhard, Bill Hader, and James McAvoy among others, and I would like to watch them sometime.

The book opens from the perspective of little Georgie in his yellow raincoat going out to play with his paper boat, and we know something bad is going to happen to him. 
What I did not see coming the extent of the gruesome death of Georgie and many others. 




I could feel a Stranger Things-like vibe from the book. 
It seems likely that this book served as inspiration for the Duffer brothers to create Stranger things. 
Derry, Maine does not feel very different from Hawkins, Indiana. 
Both are towns are cursed with deadly supernatural threats and it is up to the kids to save the town. 


I loved the time jumps. 

As usual, the middle of the book is the best. The ending wasn't great.
