I could not stop reading this book. 
One of the first books published by Brandon Sanderson.

The three main characters in the story are Raoden, the prince of Arelon, Sarene,
the princess of Teo that is married to Raoden, and Hrathen, the Fjordian priest. 

Most of the story in the book is written from the point of view of these three
characters.
