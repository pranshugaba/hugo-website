Full Name: Twenty thousand leagues under the sea  
Author: Jules Verne
{{< /note >}}
-->

I read the book Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, originally published in French as *Vingt mille lieues sous les mers* by Julese Verne. 
I read an English translation by MTB (full name?). 
My copy of the book was 450 pages long, and it took me around 2 weeks to finish reading it. 

This story was written and published serially. A new chapter would be released every fortnight from March 1869 to June 1870.
As a consequence, the format of this story is not unlike a TV serial you would see nowadays. Each chapter (or episode) ends on a cliffhanger, and didn't have much reference to the chapters before it.

It took me a long time to realize that a league is in fact a unit of length. It is about three miles or about 4.82 kilometers. It is roughly the distance one can walk in an hour. 

And only after reading the first few chapters of the book did I really think about how big a league is and how deep the oceans really are. The deepest point of the ocean is about ... deep.

Twenty thousand leagues translates to about 100,000 kilometers, and the radius of the Earth is only 6400 km. 


The book started out strongly. 
It is more of a experience than a plot. 
I need to look up more on how much information was known to people in the late 19th century. 
I am not sure if there is a sea on in the middle of antarctica.

Every other chapter contains an exhaustively long list of all the flora and
fauna that the Professor sees under the sea. 


Since this is a serialized story, I don't think Verne had the planned out the
ending in advance. 

Some issues specific to my edition: Many full stops and commas were missing.
