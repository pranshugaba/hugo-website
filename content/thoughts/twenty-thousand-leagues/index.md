Consisting of about 450 pages, I finished reading this in 2 weeks. Being a serialized story, I found that each chapter would end on a cliff hanger and didn't have much reference to the chapters before it. 

It took me a long time to realize that a league is in fact a unit of length. It is about three miles or about 4.82 kilometers. It is roughly the distance one can walk in an hour. 

And only after reading the first few chapters of the book did I really think about how big a league is and how deep the oceans really are. The deepest point of the ocean is about ... deep.

Twenty thousand leagues translates to about 100,000 kilometers, and the radius of the Earth is only 6400 km.
