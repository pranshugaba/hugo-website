For more than 10 years now, my tablet of choice has been an iPad. 
I used to use an iPad along with an Apple Pencil to jot down notes and draw illustrations.
Using the stylus is a delight, there is a almost no latency and the it is amazing.
However it needs to be charged to be used, and charging it is a finicky affair. 
You charge it by inserting it in the iPad and with the pencil jutting out of the iPad, you will realize how precarious it is and how very prone to breakage the whole setup is.

Getting a new pencil is not cheap. 
I had spent close to ₹7600 to buy the Apple Pencil six years ago, and a new one today costs even more at ₹9500.

I decided to get a new tab.
I decided I want to change sides. this time I got a new Android tablet! 
If I get any iPad that is not the base one, then the Apple pencil would cost me ₹11900. 
iPad accessories are insanely expensive. 
While, there were student discounts that gave me a free Apple pencil, the keyboard cover costs close to ₹30000.

I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE+. 
It comes along with a pen in the box, and I got a keyboard case for only ₹4000. 

I am loving it so far.
