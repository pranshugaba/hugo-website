People love to tell stories, as well as listen to stories. 
It does not matter what the plot is, whetehr the story share useful information, to recount personal experiences, or merely to entertain peers. 
Therefore, it is no surprise that storytellers are generally revered by society.[^writer strike]
People love to read books and blogs and watch movies and tv series.
While the mediums through which stories are told have evolved over time, but the idea remains. 

[^writer strike]: Not always though. Check out [writers' strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike))


For centuries, before humans developed writing, stories were told by word of mouth. 
You would hear a story from someone (or maybe come up with one of your own), and if you are brave enough, you would tell it someone else. 
You would draw paintings in the sand that would be blown away by wind and tide, and later paintings in caves, which would be preserved for centuries.
Drawing evolves to writing, and soon,
Writing only became popular after humans developed a system of written communications, and sufficiently many people learnt how to read and write. 
Written texts gained widespread prominence especially with the invention of the printing press. 
Previously, "writers" would have laboriously and pain-stakingly pen down copy after copy of the same text. 
This made the books prohibitively expensive, a luxury for the elite, a rare commodity.
However, with the advent of the printing press, books could be mass produced and shipped all over the world. Books became affordable and available. I could buy from India a book written by and printed in a press in New York.


The printing press was invented in 19??, by Gutenberg. 
If you visit a bookstore, how many books do you actually see from that time period? 
You will find some classics, in the classics sections, but they are merely a small fraction. 
You would hope to do better in a library. 
And yet, even the biggest of libraries are limited by the amount of physical space they have. 
Older books that are less popular are moved out of the main section and into the archive. 
The passage of time erases the ink from the pages, and the books from existence. 
Physical books, due to the law of physics (the second law of thermodynamics), result in a limit on discoverability and accessibility. There is a need to digitize and preserve these books so they are preserved for the future. This is where Project Gutenberg shines.

The next big leap would be internet, and ebooks. 

Just as Gutenberg printed press, the project gutenberg is the next big thing. Eponymous
This brings us to [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). This is a vast library, a treasure trove of books. 
You can browse through tens of thousands of books of different genres, written in different languages, all for free. 
You can read the books in convenient formats such as epub and pdf, that look well on an ebook reader or a phone or a tablet, or you could also read a html version right in your browser.
How are books added to this collection? 
It is mostly done by volunteers. 
To see behind the works, and maybe even contribute to the project, head over to [Distributed Proofreaders](https://pgdp.net).

  

## relation of project gutenburg with pgdp

- pgdp provides books to pg
- digitize history and make books accessible to all

  
## how pgdp obtains scans of books in public domain

- scans are obtained from old copies in libraries and what not. I don't know much about this. I will need to read the about page of PGDP.

  

## The various stages of proofreading and formatting

Going from the initial scans of a book to a readable epub, is a long and time-consuming process. 
If we are preserving history, we need to be sure that we are preserving it correctly. 
A book goes through many different stages 
This is why any book on PGDP goes through 5 or more rounds of proofreading before reaching Project Gutenberg.

There are three proofreading rounds called P1, P2, and P3. 
These make sure that there is no spelling mistakes. 
Following the proofreading, the book goes through two formatting rounds, F1 and F2, to ensure that color, images, bold, and italics are done properly.

Everyone begins in P1. Beginners are often assigned easy books: these are books where the text is often large, legible, clear, without many proper nouns and ambiguities.
To qualify for the next stage, there is number of pages that you are required to proofread, and you also need to pass a small test. 
You are encouraged to work in the highest round you are eligible for, as the highest round has the fewest members, and the books stay in P3 and F2 for very long times.

With so many volunteers processing so many different books, it is necessary that everyone adheres to a set of rules.  
The rules are detailed. There is also a interactive simulation so you get familiar with all the rules.
Each round has leaderboads. People are ranked according to the number of pages they have proofread. 

- the consistency
  

## the joy of reading random pages from old books

A wide variety of genres of books are seen that too in various languages. 
from old science textbooks, to history books, religious texts, travelogues, and more. 
It is like time travel. 
You are walking through the aisles of a quaint old library. 
You pick out a book whose title catches your fancy, you open a random page, and begin reading carefully. 
The page may (and most likely, will) begin mid-sentence. 
You have no context for the characters, the setting, and what the book is about apart from the title, the genre, and maybe, the chapter name that may be visible on every page. 
You read line by line, word by word, each line twice, once in the scan, and once in the output, comparing and scrutinizing the texts carefully, on the lookout for any differences. 
You will come across spellings and grammars that are no longer in use today. 
Today is spelled as to-day. 
You will learn facts that while useless and maybe disproved, are nevertheless interesting. 
This is no less than time-travel.

You come across a page filled with an illustration, which is most likely hand drawn or etched. 
You are happy because it is beautiful drawing, and you get a page to your contribution without having to read much. 
The process is also gamified. 
There is a leaderboard for the total number of pages proofread by every account. 
As you climb up the leaderboard, you get a sense of pride and accomplishment.

  

## The future of ocr and PGDP

This is a investment of time. Not sure if it is worth it. If anyone will ever read the obscure books. As ocr gets better and better, it gets less useful. New books will not need to be

If you have a copy of an old book with you, that is impossible to find online, and believe would do the world good by being present online, then get in touch and we can upload scans on PGDP.


## The future of public domain

You may see that Project Gutenberg only has books up till 1923. Why is this? If you want to read an Enid Blyton book or a Harry Potter book, you are out of luck. The copyright rules as of today state that a book does not become public domain until 75 years after the death of the author. It is soon to become 100 years. Imagine so many books, that could be available to the people, that are not, because of this law.

- Disney prevents books from entering the public domain. benefits no one else but the big corporations

  
## How you can help

- Proofread pages in PGDP, climb the leaderboards.
- You can [donate monetarily](https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/) to PG.
- If you have a physical copy of a book that is in the public domain but does not exist on either Project Gutenberg or Distributed Proofreaders, upload it!
- Record audio versions of books from PGDP on LibriVox.
- Spread the word about PGDP! Share this page with your friends and family!
