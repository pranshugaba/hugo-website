Most research talks are being held online post lockdown, and as a result, one can access talks from all over the world.
I came across a website that lists upcoming research seminars and makes it easier to discover interesting talks.

https://researchseminars.org/

This website was launched in April 2020 shortly after lockdown began.
It lists upcoming talks and seminars held in universities all over the world.
You can filter talks by topic, language, institution, and more.

For each talk, the site shows details such as the title, abstract, speaker, the targeted audience, and a link to the seminar's website.
Most talks have a livestream link available (either interactive like Zoom / Google Meet / Microsoft Teams or viewing only such as Youtube).
Links for some talks are not be available unless you register on this site.

Try to attend and participate in talks that pique your interest. The feeling of being able to attend a talk held halfway across the world is unmatched.
