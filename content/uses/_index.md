## Laptop

I run [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) (btw) on my ThinkPad P1 as my daily driver. 
I use [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), a beautiful tiling window compositor for Wayland. 
I absolutely love using tiling window managers. 
Their customizability and efficiency is streets ahead compared to floating window managers.

Previously, I used the [GNOME desktop environment](https://www.gnome.org/).
It is simple, elegant, stable, and a joy to use.
However, it is no match for a tiling window manager. 
Even more previously, I used to use the tiling window manager [XMonad](https://xmonad.org). However, I had to switch as it does not support Wayland (yet).


### Text Editor

I mostly use [Neovim](neovim) to edit text files. I occasionally use VSCodium as well.

### Browser

I use Firefox with these extensions:
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block those pesky ads
- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for those sweet vim keybindings
- [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) so I don't blind myself with bright websites
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to generate and remember all my passwords
- [Netflix 1080p](https://github.com/TheGoddessInari/netflix-1080p-firefox) to force Netflix to stream in 1080p on Linux
- [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) to display additional pricing info on Steam pages
