## Laptop

I am running [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) on my ThinkPad P1, btw.
While I mainly use [XMonad](https://xmonad.org), I occasionally use GNOME on Wayland. 

### Text Editor

I mostly use [Neovim](neovim) to edit text files. I used to use VSCodium, but I have prefer Neovim now.

### Browser

I use Firefox with these extensions:
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block those pesky ads
- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for those sweet vim keybindings
- [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) so I don't blind myself with bright websites
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to generate and remember all my passwords
- [Netflix 1080p](https://github.com/TheGoddessInari/netflix-1080p-firefox) to force Netflix to stream in 1080p on Linux
- [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) to display additional pricing info on Steam pages
