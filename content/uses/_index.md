## Laptop

I use [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org), btw, on my ThinkPad P1 as my daily driver. 
I used to use the tiling window manager [XMonad](https://xmonad.org). 
However, I find the touchpad gestures of [GNOME on Wayland](https://www.gnome.org/) much smoother and a joy to use, and since XMonad does not support Wayland, I now use GNOME as my desktop environment. I still prefer XMonad when I am on desktop.

### Text Editor

I mostly use [Neovim](neovim) to edit text files. I occasionally use VSCodium as well.

### Browser

I use Firefox with these extensions:
- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block those pesky ads
- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for those sweet vim keybindings
- [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) so I don't blind myself with bright websites
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to generate and remember all my passwords
- [Netflix 1080p](https://github.com/TheGoddessInari/netflix-1080p-firefox) to force Netflix to stream in 1080p on Linux
- [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) to display additional pricing info on Steam pages
