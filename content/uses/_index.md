## Laptop

I use [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) with the [GNOME desktop environment](https://www.gnome.org/) on my ThinkPad L14 as my daily driver.
It is simple, elegant, stable, and a joy to use.

Previously, I ran [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) (btw) on my ThinkPad P1 with [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), a beautiful tiling window compositor for Wayland.
I love using tiling window managers.
Their customizability and efficiency is streets ahead compared to floating window managers.
Even more previously, I have used the tiling window managers [XMonad](https://xmonad.org), herbsluftwm, and awesomewm.
However, I had to switch as these do not support Wayland.

### Text Editor

I use [Neovim](neovim) to edit my text files.

### Browser

I use Firefox with these extensions:

- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block those pesky ads
- [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) to customise the appearance on various websites using CSS
- [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube) for additional customisations on YouTube
- [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) to skip over sponsored segments in videos on YouTube
- [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) so I don't blind myself with bright websites at night
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to generate and remember all my passwords
- [Netflux](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/netflux/) to force Netflix to stream in 1080p on Linux

Some other interesting extensions that I have used in the past.

- [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) to display additional pricing info on Steam pages
- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for those sweet vim keybindings
- Firenvim to convert every text box into an instance of Neovim.
