## Laptop

I use a distribution of Linux called [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) on my laptop.
I mostly use it with [Niri](https://yalter.github.io/niri/), a scrollable tiling Wayland compositor.
It is very light on resource consumption, extremely customizable, and a joy to use using just the keyboard.

Before Niri, I used to use (and still sometimes use)[^1] the [GNOME desktop environment](https://www.gnome.org/). 
It is simple, elegant, stable, and a joy to use.
It is easy to get started with, works great out of the box, and this is the desktop environment (DE) that comes by default with distros such as Fedora and Ubuntu.
If you are new to Linux, this is the DE that I recommend that you start with.

[^1]: There are some features that I do not know how to get working in niri such as remote input with KDE Connect and file sharing over network. When I need these features, I briefly use GNOME.


Previously, I ran [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) (btw) with [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), a beautiful tiling window compositor for Wayland.
Even more previously, I have used the tiling window managers [XMonad](https://xmonad.org), herbsluftwm, and awesomewm.
However, I had to switch away from them as they do not support Wayland.

### Text Editor

I used to use [Neovim](https://neovim.io) to edit my text files.
Neovim is easily my favourite text editor.
The learning curve was steep and I spent some time configuring and tinkering with it to my liking. 

But I now have a new favourite text editor. 
I have switched to [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/emacs.html).

### Browser

I use Firefox with these extensions:

- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block those pesky ads
- [LeechBlock NG](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) to add timers and limits to websites that are addictive timesinks.
- [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube) for additional customisations on YouTube
- [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) to skip over sponsored segments in videos on YouTube
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) to generate and remember all my passwords
- [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) so I don't blind myself with bright websites at night
- [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) to customise the appearance on various websites using CSS


Some other extensions that I have used in the past:

- [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) to display additional pricing info on Steam pages
- [Tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) for those sweet vim keybindings
- Firenvim to convert every text box into an instance of Neovim.
- Gesturefy
- ~Tree Style Tab~ This has become redundant to me Firefox introduced vertical tabs.
- ~[Netflux](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/netflux/) to force Netflix to stream in 1080p on Linux.~
It turns out that for some arcane reason Netflix now supports 1080p video on Linux but only on the Opera browser. So you can now get Full HD videos on Netflix on Linux without having to install any extensions.

### Terminal emulator

- Kitty

### Reading
- I use [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) when I am using niri and Evince when I using GNOME to read PDF files.
- Foliate is an excellent ePUB reader.

All of my note taking takes place in emacs using the org mode.

Xournalpp is my preferred application to take handwritten notes and to annotate PDFs.
