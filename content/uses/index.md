## Laptop

### Operating system

I use a distribution of Linux called [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) on my laptop.
I mostly use it with [niri](https://yalter.github.io/niri/), a beautiful scrollable tiling Wayland compositor.
Niri is very light on resource consumption, extremely customizable, and a joy to use using just the keyboard.
As the name suggests, if you open a new window, niri neatly places it next to the existing ones like tiles instead of opening over them.
This way, windows never overlap (unless you want them to) and window management is easy and efficient.

The default install of niri is pretty barebones. 
You have to install additional software and play around with the config to get it to work the way you want it to work, so niri is recommended only if you have at least a moderate proficiency in Linux and you love tinkering with things.

Before niri, I used to use (and still sometimes use)[^1] the [GNOME desktop environment](https://www.gnome.org/). 
It is simple, elegant, stable, and a joy to use.
It is easy to get started with and works great out of the box.
This is the desktop environment (DE) that comes by default with distros such as Fedora and Ubuntu, and if you are new to Linux, this is the DE that I recommend that you start with.

[^1]: There are some features that I do not know how to get working in niri such as remote input with KDE Connect and file sharing over network. When I need these features, I briefly use GNOME.


Previously, I ran [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) (btw) with [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/), another tiling Wayland compositor.
Even more previously, I have used the tiling window managers [XMonad](https://xmonad.org), [herbsluftwm](https://herbstluftwm.org/), and [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/).
However, I had to switch away from them as they do not support Wayland.

### Text Editor

I used to use [Neovim](https://neovim.io) to edit my text files.
Neovim was easily my favourite text editor.
I could not imagine using any other text editor, ever.

But ever since I switched my [keyboard layout](#keyboard-remapping), vim motions became inconvenient and emacs became a lot more ergonomic.
So I switched to [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/emacs/emacs.html).
It is now my favourite text editor, by far, and I cannot imagine using any other text editor, ever.

### Keyboard remapping

I use [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata/) to remap all the keys on my laptop.
More details on how and why coming soon...

### Browser

I use Firefox with the following extensions:

- [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) to block all pesky ads, warn me about dangerous redirects, and to block any element from any website that I do not want to see.
- [LeechBlock NG](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) to add time limits and blocks to websites that are addictive timesinks.
- [Bitwarden Password Manager](https://bitwarden.com/) to generate and store all my passwords.
- [Enhancer for YouTube](https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube) for cool customizations on YouTube such as adding a mini popup player, hiding shorts and recommended videos, and so much more.
- [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) to skip over sponsored segments in videos on YouTube.

### Terminal emulator

I use [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): it is fast, performant, and customizable, and featureful.
When I am in emacs, which is most of the time, I use the shell that is part of emacs.

### Reading
- I use [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) when I am using niri and [GNOME Papers](https://apps.gnome.org/Papers/) when I using GNOME to read PDF files.
- [Foliate](https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/) is an excellent ePUB reader.
- [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) for ebook management.

### Note-taking

All of my note-taking takes place in emacs using the org mode.

Xournalpp is my preferred application to take handwritten notes and to annotate PDFs.
