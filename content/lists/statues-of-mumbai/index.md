We love statues.

We pass them without noticing them. But there they always there, standing, sitting, or even riding a horse. Here is my attempt to curate a list of statues that exist in my city.

I will continually update this list as I come across more statues. 

Some statues can be seen in day or night. Click on "toggle lights" at the bottom of the page to change the time in the photos.

There are currently 4 statues on this list. Click on a marker on a map to jump to that statue, or just scroll through the pictures.

{{< map-markers "statues" >}}

If you know some statues that could be added to this list, [let me know]({{< ref "/contact" >}})!
