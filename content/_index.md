Hi there, hello! :wave:

I am a PhD student in Theoretical Computer Science at [TIFR, Mumbai](https://www.tifr.res.in). 
My research interests include Logic, Automata, and Games, as well as Algebra and Combinatorics.

I occasionally publish 
[puzzles]({{< ref "/puzzles" >}}) 
and [photopoetry]({{< ref "/poems" >}})
on this site.
