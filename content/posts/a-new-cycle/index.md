I ordered a road bike online from Decathlon, and it was available for pickup from their store in Bandra. Given the lovely cloudy July weather, I decided to cycle back home to Kandivali.

I tried to avoid the main roads --- using parallel roads that were less busy instead. I got lost in Versova once, and had to backtrack for a bit. 
As a result, I ended up cycling 27 kilometres, even though Bandra is only 18 kilometres away from my home.

Here's the route that I took, as well as some interesting photos I clicked on the way.
