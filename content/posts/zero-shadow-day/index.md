The noon (12:00) rarely corresponds to the time when the sun is at its highest point in the sky.

Local noon will vary from place to place, and also depends on the day of the year.

The earth makes an angle of 23.5 degrees with the plane. It

The poles do not see the sun for long periods of time.

For places that between 23.5 degrees north and 23.5 degrees south, (also known as Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricon respectively) there are days when there is zero shadow. 

If you live outside these latitudes, then this will never happen. 

I am staying in Mumbai, which is at 19.1 degrees north latitude. Every year, 15 May and 26 Aug are zero shadow days. 

Everything looks surreal, kind of like a video game where the shadows do not render. 


This site by alok is a great place to visualise when zero shadow days occur at what places. 
They have made an Android app as well.
