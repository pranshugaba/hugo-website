When the clock strikes twelve during the day, we call this time _noon_. This is _not_ the time when the sun at its highest point in the day. This is mainly due to the timezones being discrete, and the same timezone can span across a degree of longitudes. For example, all of India follows the same timezone: UTC +5:30. But the distance between the westmost point in Gujarat is 68.2 degrees, and the east most point in Arunachal pradesh is 97.4 degrees. The difference is about 30 degrees. This means that the sun rises in Arunachal Pradesh a full two hours before Gujarat. Equivalently, the time when the sun is at its highest point in Gujarat is also two hours after the same time in Arunachal Pradesh. It follows that 12:00 on the clock rarely, if ever, corresponds to the time when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. It varies from place to place. 

The time at which the sun is at its highest point in the sky is called the *local noon*, and it varies from place to place. 

The local noon at the same place also changes day to day across the year. 


Okay, so suppose you have found when the local noon is happening in your place. Your shadow will be the shortest at this time of the day. It would be reasonable to expect that you would not see your shadow at all, since the sun is directly overhead. This is not quite true. 

The earth makes an angle of 23.5 degrees with the plane. It

The poles do not see the sun for long periods of time.

For places that between 23.5 degrees north and 23.5 degrees south, (also known as Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn respectively) there are days when there is zero shadow. 

If you live outside these latitudes, then this will never happen. 

I am staying in Mumbai, which is at 19.1 degrees north latitude. Every year, 15 May and 26 Aug are zero shadow days. 

Everything looks surreal, kind of like a video game where the shadows do not render. 


This site by Alok is a great place to visualise when zero shadow days occur at what places. 
They have made an Android app as well.
