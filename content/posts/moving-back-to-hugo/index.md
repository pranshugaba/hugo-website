Not more than 2 months ago, I had migrated my site from Hugo to Nuxt, and I had [written a post]({{< ref "../moving-from-hugo-to-nuxt" >}}) describing why I chose to do so. Now I am back to using Hugo. 

## My (short) experience with Nuxt

I had added quite a many features to my site in Nuxt. I was very happy with my site, it looked so pretty!

I was styling my site using Tailwind, and it was amazing not having to think of names for classes any more. 

Using Vue js, I was able to make reusable components. 

I wrote a 7000 word long tutorial on how to make a game in Godot. 

I started facing performance issues, both while building, as well as during browsing my site.

## My new site built with Hugo

I started missing the simplicity of Hugo. 

## Conclusions

I like my stack now. It is boring, and that's a good thing. 

I have redesigned my site twice in the last three months, and have spent hardly any time writing content. I am done adding new features to this site now. It  has all I need. Now, I just need to start writing good content.
